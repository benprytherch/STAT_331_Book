    "text": "Purpose and intended audience\nSTAT 331, as the title states, is an “applied” statistics course. It is intended for anyone who has taken at least one introductory level statistics course, and who wants to learn more about the use of statistical methods in quantitative research.\nIt covers many statistical tools that are usually considered too advanced for an introductory level class, but are nonetheless very popular. It also provides guidance on making data analysis decisions.\nMost assignments will involve looking up a published scientific paper for which the data are available and reproducing the main results. There are many worked examples that go through the statistical analyses in used in specific published papers.\nSTAT 331 doesn’t require any coding; the software we use is jamovi, a GUI-based (meaning “graphical user interface”, aka “point-and-click”) statistical analysis package. Jamovi is built on to of R, and for those interested in using R it has the ability to display the R code it creates under the hood.\nSTAT 331 is not mathematically heavy in the traditional sense, but it isn’t math-free either. My approach is to present mathematical formulas and expressions when they are necessary or at least helpful for understanding the statistical it’s being covered. There are no mathematical character-building exercises or examples, and we won’t be computing things by hand - the software does all the computational work. Our job is to make sense of the results. And that usually requires looking at formulas and figuring out what they do. We will be constantly answering the question “what does this number mean?”"

    "text": "1.3 Commonly used statistics\n\n1.3.1 Mean\nMean and median identify the center of a data set or distribution.\nThe mean of a variable \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\bar{X}\\).\nTo calculate the mean of a data set, add up all the values of a variable and divide by how many there are.\n\\[\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}x_i}{n}\n\\]\n\n\n1.3.2 Median\nMedian is the “middle” number in a data set. To find the median, put the data values in order from smallest to largest, and identify the number in the middle.\nIf there are an even number of data points, the median is the average of the middle two numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Mean vs. Median\nIn statistical inference (the process of generalizing from sample to population), we most often draw inference on the population mean.\nSometimes, though, the median is a more sensible statistic than the mean.\nThis is usually the case when we are studying a “skewed” distribution.\nSkewed distributions are distributions that take on values that are extreme (or outlying) values.\nExample: income. Most households have incomes between $20,000/yr and $100,000/yr. A handful of households have incomes in the millions or billions of dollars per year.\nThe mean is affected by outliers. The median is not. This is why we often hear about “median household income” rather than “mean household income”.\n\n\n1.3.4 jamovi example: mean vs. median\nTry creating a skewed data set in jamovi, then analyzing it by selecting for mean and median in the Statistics drop down menu in Descriptives, found under Exploration in the Analysis tab\nTo create a new dataset, enter data into the blank data table jamovi creates by default:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Variance and standard deviation\nThe center of a distribution is quantified by the mean or the median.\nThe variability (i.e. spread) of a distribution is quantified by the standard deviation, which is closely related to the variance.\nThe variance of a distribution or data set is denoted \\(s^2\\):\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nThe standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\n\\]\nThink of this as the “standard” amount by which values deviate from their mean.\nWe will most often look at standard deviation, because it is the more interpretable of the two statistics. It is in the same units as the original variable.\n\n\n1.3.6 The correlation coefficient\nThe correlation coefficient, 𝑟, quantifies the extent to which two variables (call them X and Y) move together:\n\\[\nr = (\\frac{1}{n-1})\\sum^n_{i=1}\\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{s_xs_y} = (\\frac{1}{n-1})\\sum^n_{i=1}z_{x_i}z_{y_i}\n\\]\nDon’t worry too much about the formula. The most important things to know are:\nWhen two variables move in the opposite direction (i.e. when one gets bigger, the other gets smaller), \\(r\\) is negative.\nWhen they move in the same direction, \\(r\\) is positive.\n\\(r = 0\\) means no correlation. \\(r =1\\) means perfect positive correlation. \\(r = -1\\) means perfect negative correlation."

If it has a large standard error, its value might be very far away from the value of the parameter.\nExample: the standard error of \\(\\bar{X}\\) is \\(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) i.e. \\(s_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\n\n1.5.2 Sampling dist. and standard error, visually\nOn Canvas there is a Central Limit Theorem simulator.\nWhen the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample mean is not very spread out.

    "text": "1.6 Confidence intervals\nA confidence interval (“CI”) is an interval (i.e. a left endpoint and a right endpoint) constructed around a statistic, when that statistic is being treated as an estimate for the value of an unknown parameter.\nTypical confidence intervals are constructed by adding a “margin of error” to, and subtracting it from, an estimate:\n𝐶𝐼 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟 = 𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟 ± 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟\nTypical margins of error are calculated by multiplying the standard error of the estimate by a “critical value”. A critical value comes from a known distribution and is given by a confidence level.\nExample: a 95% CI for a population mean uses a critical value from the \\(t\\) distribution (we won’t cover why this is).\n𝐶𝐼 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝜇 = \\(\\bar{x}\\) ± \\(𝑡_{𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙}\\) ∗ \\(s_{\\bar{x}}\\)\nAs long as \\(n\\) isn’t tiny, the 95% critical value from a \\(t\\) distribution is approximately 2:\n𝐶𝐼 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝜇 ≈ \\(\\bar{x}\\) ± \\(2\\) ∗ \\(s_{\\bar{x}}\\)\nConfidence intervals should capture the unknown parameter value being estimated. The confidence level gives how often the interval captures the parameter under repeated sampling.\nExample: 95% of all 95% CIs for \\(\\mu\\) capture \\(\\mu\\) .\nThe confidence level can also be thought of as the success rate of the method being used.\nSo, 95% confidence intervals have a 95% success rate in capturing the value of the unknown parameter.\nJust as with sampling distributions, we are invoking repeated sampling here. We say that a 95% CI can be trusted because it is created using a method that would “work” 95% of the time, if we were to keep taking new samples and keep constructing 95% CIs."

    "text": "2.1 The linear regression equation\nLinear regression, in its simplest form, is a method for finding the “best fitting” line through a set of bivariate (two variable) data:\n\nWhat is meant by “best fitting” will be addressed shortly. For now, think of the line as showing the underlying linear trend through a set of data.\nThe vertical distance between each data point and the line is called a “residual”. On the plot above, the red lines represent residuals. They quantify the amount by which a data point deviates from the underlying linear trend. Every point has a residual; the plot above only shows a few of them.\n\n2.1.1 The linear regression equation as a statistical model\nThe line that is drawn through data comes from a statistical model. A statistical model is a mathematical expression describing how data are generated. It has a fixed component and a random component. Think of the fixed component as describing the underlying relationship between variables, and the random component as describing any additional variability in data beyond what the fixed component describes.\nBelow is the standard linear regression model. The random component is represented by \\(``\\varepsilon_i\"\\). Everything from “\\(\\beta_0\\)” up until “\\(\\varepsilon_i\\)” is the fixed component.\n\\[\nY_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_kx_{ki} + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\ni = 1, \\dots, n \\\\\n\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(0,\\sigma^2)\n\\]\nHere’s what each term represents:\n\n\\(i\\) is the index term. It counts through the data, starting at \\(i = 1\\) and going through \\(i=n\\), where \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) value of the outcome variable. When written in upper-case, \\(Y_i\\) is treated as a random variable whose value has not been observed. When written lower-case, \\(y_i\\) represents an observed data value.\n\\(Y_i\\) is often referred to as the “response” variable, or the “dependent” variable. These notes will use the term “outcome” variable. I prefer this term on the grounds that the others seem to imply causality: if \\(Y\\) is “responding” to \\(x\\), or “dependent” on \\(x\\), then it sounds like changing the value of \\(x\\) will induce a change in the value of \\(Y\\).\n\\(x_{1i}\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) value of the first predictor (i.e. independent) variable. \\(x_{2i}\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) value of the second predictor, etc. The \\(x's\\) are always written lower-case, and technically are assumed to be fixed values, either set prior to data collection or measured without error.\n\\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope (i.e. regression coefficient) for the first predictor variable. \\(\\beta_2\\) is the slope of the second predictor, etc. The \\(\\beta's\\) are parameters, meaning their values are treated as fixed (existing at the “population” level) but unknown.\nWe use data to calculate estimated values for the \\(\\beta's\\), and these estimates are written using hat notation. For example, \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) is the estimated value for \\(\\beta_1\\).\n\\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) random error value. This is the amount by which \\(Y_i\\) differs from \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_kx_{ki}\\), i.e. the fixed component of the model.\nThe amount by which \\(y_i\\) (the \\(i^{th}\\) observed value of \\(y\\)) differs from \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}+\\hat{\\beta_1}x_{1i} + \\hat{\\beta_2}x_{2i} + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta_k}x_{ki}\\) is called the \\(i^{th}\\) residual, which we can denote \\(e_i\\).\nThe errors are modeled as random values that are drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe errors in a regression model do not have to come from a normal distribution. This assumption is made in order to justify inferences about the coefficients; more on this soon.\n\n\nWhen a regression model has only one predictor variable, it is called a “simple” regression model. If it has more than one predictor variable, it is called a “multiple regression” model.\n\n\n2.1.2 Assumptions of the regression model\nThis model implies some assumptions:\n\nThe response variable \\(Y\\) is an additive, linear function of the predictors (the \\(x\\) variables)\nIf we fix the value(s) of the \\(x\\) variable(s), all values of \\(Y\\) will be normally distributed. In other words, the errors are normally distributed.\nThe errors have the same variance regardless of the values of the \\(x's\\). This variance is denoted \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe square root of the variance is the standard deviation, denoted \\(\\sigma\\). Standard deviation is expressed in the same units of the original variable, whereas variance is expressed in squared units.\nFor this reason, standard deviation is typically referred to when interpreting statistical results. Variance has desirable mathematical properties, and so is more often referred to in statistical theory\n\n\nVisually, this model treats values of Y as being generated randomly from normal distributions centered on the line:\n\n(figure derived from OpenStax Introductory Business Statistics, section 13.4)\nThe “errors” are the distances between the line and the values generated from the normal distributions.\nThe errors are treated as random and uncorrelated: knowing the value of one error tells you nothing about the likely value of the next."

    "text": "2.2 Regression analysis in jamovi\n\n2.2.1 Simulating the regression model in jamovi\nWe noted earlier that a statistical model is data generating. It describes, mathematically, how values of the outcome variable \\(Y\\) can be created. Consider the “simple” (single \\(x\\) ) regression model:\n\\[\nY_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i} + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(0,\\sigma^2)\n\\]\nIf we have values for \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), and \\(\\sigma^2\\), when we can plug in values for \\(x_i\\) to generate values for \\(Y_i\\). Let’s do this using jamovi.\nIn jamovi, we first create X values by double-clicking an empty column, choosing “New Computed Variable” then the \\(f_x\\) drop down menu and double click UNIF.\n\nHere, we are generating 100 random values from a \\(Uniform(0,100)\\) distribution. The uniform distribution is a distribution where all values are equally likely, so we should get an even spread of values between 0 and 100.\nTo simulate values of the response variable, we’ll need to make up values for each parameter in the model. Say we want to generate values from this model:\n\\(Y_i=10+0.7x_i+\\varepsilon_i \\quad \\varepsilon_i \\sim Normal(0,8^2)\\)\nThis means we’ve decided that \\(\\beta_0=10\\), \\(\\beta_1=0.7\\), and \\(\\sigma=8\\). And since we’ve generated 100 values for \\(x_i\\), we’ve also decided that \\(i=1\\dots 100\\)\nDouble click an empty column and choose “New Computed Variable”:\n\nNow make the formula look like the right side of the regression equation from the previous slide:\n\nNow we can take a look using Scatterplot, a downloadable jamovi module. Click the icon of the plus sign labeled “Modules” to bring up a list of available modules you can install. We will use many modules in STAT 331.\n\nAfter installation, Scatterplot is available under Exploration in the Analyses tab. You can assign the X and Y axis variables, and get a plot that looks something like this:\n\nThese are random data, so yours will look a little bit different. But the scales of the axes and vertical spread of the data should be similar.\nNext, we’ll fit a regression model to this data. In practice, we do not know the values of the parameters in our model, so we estimate them using data. This is known as “fitting” the model to the data. The point of this simulation is to look at what kind of results we get when fiting a regression model to fake data that was produced by a mechanism we fully understand.\n\n\n2.2.2 Fitting a regression model in jamovi\nWe can use Regression / Linear Regression to fit a “simple” regression model, which is a regression model with just one predictor.\n\nThe response variable is “Dependent Variable”.\nThe predictor variable goes under “Covariates”.\n\nAfter selecting variables, model will automatically be fit, and output will be generated to the right under “Results”.\n\nBased on these results, here is the estimated regression model:\n\\[\n\\hat{y_i}=\\hat{\\beta_0}+\\hat{\\beta_1}x_i=9.1+0.71x_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}=\\sqrt{MSE}=\\sqrt{64.8}=7.93\n\\]\nNote that it is standard to denote estimated values using “hats”. The “estimate” column is where we find the values for the estimated regression coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\). “RMSE” (“root mean square error”) is the estimated standard deviation of the errors, assumed to have come from a normal distribution. Compare these results to the values used to generate our fake data:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\beta_0=10 &\\beta_1=0.7 \\quad &\\sigma=8 \\\\\n&\\hat{\\beta_0}=9.099 &\\hat{\\beta_1}=0.712 \\quad &\\hat{\\sigma}=7.93 \\\\\n&s_{\\hat{\\beta_0}}=1.776 &s_{\\hat{\\beta_1}}=0.034\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n2.2.3 The \\(R^2\\) statistic\nNote that the output tells us \\(R^2=0.874\\). This is a statistic quantifying how well this model can “predict” the data used to fit it. It is found from the “sum of squares” values in the ANOVA table, Generically:\n\\[\nR^2=\\frac{\\text{model sum of squares}}{\\text{total sum of squares}}=\\frac{\\text{model sum of squares}}{\\text{model sum of squares + residual sum of squares}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“Sums of squares” are used to quantify variance. You can think of this as being short for “sum of the squared distances between some values and their mean”. For example, the variance statistic is\n\\[\ns^2=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\bar{y})}{n-1}\\\n\\] The numerator, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\bar{y})\\), is a “sum of squares” - the sum of the squared deviations between all the values of \\(y_i\\) and their mean, \\(\\bar{y}\\).\n\n\nIn this example:\n\\[\nR^2=\\frac{29162}{29162+4211}=0.874\n\\]\nSo, in this case, \\(87.4\\%\\) of the total variance in \\(Y\\) can be accounted for using the values of \\(x\\). Here’s the data again, with the estimated regression line added:\n\n\nThe total variance in \\(Y\\) quantifies how much the data vary vertically around the horizontal red line, which is the mean of \\(Y\\).\nThe residual (or “error”) variance quantifies how much the data vary vertically around the regression line.\n\nHere, the data are relatively much closer to the regression line than to the the horizontal mean line, and so residual sum of squares is only a small portion of the total sum of squares, making \\(R^2\\) fairly large.\nAn alternative interpretation of \\(R^2\\) is that is quantifies the proportional decrease in residual variance when using the regression line rather than using only the mean of \\(Y\\).\nLooking at the plot above, you can imagine drawing vertical lines from each data point to the horizontal red line representing the mean of \\(Y\\). If you squared these lines and added them up, you’d have the total sum of squares, which would also be the residual sum of squares if you were using only the mean of \\(Y\\) to calculate residuals. In this case, using the regression line instead of just the mean to calculate residuals would represent an \\(87.4\\%\\) decrease in residual sum of squares.\nSaid differently, \\(R^2\\) tells you how much better your predictions for \\(Y\\) would be if you use the regression line rather than only the mean.\n\n\n2.2.4 There is no “good” or “bad” value for \\(R^2\\)\nWhen residual variance in \\(Y\\) is larger, \\(R^2\\) is smaller. Visually, when the data are more spread out around the regression line, \\(R^2\\) is smaller. Is this “bad”? I want you to resist such an interpretation. A small \\(R^2\\) tells you that \\(Y\\) is being influenced by a lot more than just what is in your model. And this is often to be expected.\nFor instance, if I’m trying to predict how many tomatoes are produced per tomato plant in different parts of the country and my only predictor variable is average daily outdoor temperature, I should not expect a large \\(R^2\\). This is because there are many many more variables that influence how many tomatoes will grow (e.g. properties of soil, watering schedule, fertilizer, pests…). But, a small \\(R^2\\) should not be interpreted as “average daily outdoor temperature doesn’t matter when growing tomatoes”. It should be interpreted as “there are way more other things that matter when growing tomatoes, and their combined influence is much greater than average daily outdoor temperature alone”."

It tells us how much the response variable changes, on average, when the predictor variable increases by one unit.\nThis interpretation is very common. It is also dangerous, because it is phrased in a way that suggests changes in 𝑥 cause changes in \\(y\\).\nHere is an alternate, non-causal sounding interpretation:\nIf we observe two values of \\(x\\) that are one unit apart, we estimate that their corresponding average \\(y\\) values will be \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) units apart.\nVisually, we can choose two values of \\(x\\), go up to the line, and record the values of \\(y\\).

    "text": "2.6 Interaction\n“Interaction” is the phenomenon by which the association between a predictor variable and a response variable is itself dependent on the value of another predictor.\nSay we have response \\(y\\), one predictor \\(x_1\\), and another predictor \\(x_2\\). We say that \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) interact if the amount of change in \\(y\\) associated with a change in \\(x_1\\) is different for different values of \\(x_2\\), or vice versa.\nYou can think of this as saying that the “slope” of \\(x_1\\) depends upon the value of \\(x_2\\).\nAnother way of saying it: if the answer to the question:\n“How much does our estimate for \\(y\\) change when \\(x_1\\) changes?“\nis:\n“It depends on the value of \\(x_2\\)“,\nthen \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) interact.\n\n2.6.1 Interaction example\nSuppose a drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis is more effective at reducing inflammation for younger patients than it is for older patients.\nIf we conduct an experiment in which inflammation is the response variable and the predictors are treatment group (drug vs. control) and age, then we expect treatment group and age to interact.\nThis is different from saying that age and treatment both affect inflammation. It means that the extent to which treatment affects inflammation is different for patients of different age.\nSometimes interaction is referred to as “moderation”. This is common in the social and behavioral sciences, particularly Psychology.\nSo, a “moderator” variable is one that changes how the primary predictor of interest relates to the response.\nExample: suppose an experiment shows that subjects holding a pen with their teeth rate cartoons as funnier vs. subjects holding a pen with their lips.\nSuppose also that this “pen in teeth” effect disappears if subjects see a video camera in the room.\nIn this case, the presence of the video camera “moderates” the effect of the pen on cartoon ratings. In the language of interaction, the presence of the pen and the presence of the video camera “interact”.\n\nThis is based on a real study that has generated controversy, see:\nhttps://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/11/01/facial-feedback-findings-suggest-minute-differences-experimental-protocol-might-lead-theoretically-meaningful-changes-outcomes/\n\n\n\n2.6.2 Interaction, in the regression model\nMathematically, we create an interaction variable by multiplying predictor variables by one another.\nSo, if we want to allow \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) to interact, we simply make a new variable defined as \\(x_1*x_2\\).\nThis interaction variable will be used as an additional predictor variable in the regression model:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} +\\beta_3(x_1x_2)_i + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0,\\sigma^2)\n\\]\nThe interaction coefficient is \\(\\beta_3\\) in this model:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} +\\beta_3(x_1x_2)_i + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0,\\sigma^2)\n\\]\nTo interpret this, let’s look at how it affects the coefficients (aka slopes) for \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\nWe can think of the “slope” of a predictor as everything it is being multiplied by.\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} +\\beta_3(x_1x_2)_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(x_1\\) from the above regression equation gives:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3x_{2i})x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nSimilarly, factoring out \\(x_2\\) gives:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + (\\beta_2 + \\beta_3x_{1i})x_{2i} + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nSo, for this model, the “slope” of \\(x_1\\) is \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_3x_2\\), and the “slope” of \\(x_2\\) is \\(\\beta_2 + \\beta_3x_1\\)\nIn other words, the slope of \\(x_1\\) depends on the value of \\(x_2\\), and vice versa. For different values of \\(x_2\\), the “predicted change in \\(y\\) for a one unit increase in \\(x_1\\)” (i.e. the slope of \\(x_1\\)) will be different.\nA simpler way of saying this is that, if two predictors interact, then the effect of one predictor on the response depends on the value of the other predictor.\n(This is a simpler interpretation, but also potentially misleading in that the term “effect” sounds causal. Nonetheless it is commonly used language when interpreting slopes.)"

These show the standard error for the average value of y (“before”), given x (“age”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.0.4 Difference vs. before\nWe don’t see an association between amount of inflammation before treatment and reduction in inflammation…\n\n\n\n\n\n… but maybe we do if we add in drug! Do “drug” and “before” interact here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.0.5 Difference vs. age\nWe see a small negative correlation between difference and age…\n\n\n\n\n\n… but when we add drug, we see no correlation for the NSAID and clear negative correlation for the DMARD. Definite interaction!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.0.6 Now with model output…\nThe following slides show the plots again, plus the regression output JMP produces. First up, Difference vs. Drug, using t-test:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd using regression:\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG! The estimated slope for “drug” is the same as the difference in means between the drugs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.0.7 Before vs. age\n\n\n\n2.7.0.8 Difference vs. age, with drug interaction\nHere, we are fitting the model:\n\\[\nDifference_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1age_i + \\beta_2drug_i + \\beta_3(age*drug)_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nTo do this, create a new column in jamovi, defined as \\(age*drug\\). May as well label it “\\(age*drug\\)“.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the slope of “age” by itself is for when drug = 0. The age*treatment interaction shows how much the slope of “age” changes when treatment = 1.\n\\[\n\\widehat{difference} = 2.0114 + 0.0125(age) + 15.1586(drug) -0.2493(age*drug)\n\\]\nSlope of “age” when drug = 1 is: \\(0.0125 − 0.2493 = −0.2368\\)\nNotice also that the slope of “age” by itself is nowhere close to being statistically significant (the estimate is less than half the standard error), but the slope of the interaction is highly significant (the estimate is 6 times as large as the standard error)\nNow take a look at the plot. There is a clear negative correlation between age and difference when drug = 1. There is essentially none when drug = 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of thinking about this interaction:\n\nIf we ask the question: “how does inflammation reduction differ by age?”, the answer is “it depends on which drug the patient took.”\nSimilarly, if we ask the question: “how does inflammation reduction differ by drug?”, the answer is “it depends on the age of the patient.”\n\n\n\n\n2.7.0.9 Interaction is NOT correlation!\nIn this example, we see a clear interaction between drug and age: the slope for age is negative for DMARD and flat for NSAID.\nAnother way of thinking about this: DMARD appears to be more effective for younger patients than for older patients. NSAID appears to be equally effective regardless of age.\nHOWEVER – this does NOT mean that treatment and age are correlated!\nThis should make sense, after all patients were randomly assigned to one of the two drugs. If drug were correlated with age, there would be bias in this study. The whole point of randomization is to remove correlations!\nJust to confirm, here is the distribution of age, split by drug:\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, age and drug “interact” when it comes to their associations with the differences in inflammation scores: the association between “age” and “difference” is different for the two different drugs.\nSimilarly, the association between “drug” and “difference” is different for patients of different ages.\nBut, age and drug are not correlated with one another!"

But \\(age = 0\\) is not of interest.\nPlug in mean age (52.096) and see what happens to the slope for drug:\n\\[\n15.1586(drug) − 0.2493(52.096*drug) \\\\\n= (15.1586 − 0.2493 ∗ 52.096)(drug)\\\\\n= 2.171(𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔)\n\\]\nSo, for patients at mean age, the predicted difference in inflammation is 2.171 units greater under the DMARD than under the NSAID\nThis process of estimating slopes at the average value of predictors can be done via “centering”\nCentering means subtracting the mean from a variable’s distribution.\nIn this example, \\(centered\\text{ }age = age - \\overline{age} = age - 52.096\\)\nThis is very useful when using interaction terms in a regression model.\n\n2.8.0.1 Centered interaction in jamovi\nTo center age, create a new columns called “centered age”, defined as age – VMEAN(age).\nCreate another new column for “centered drug”, defined as drug – VMEAN(drug). Now create a final column defined as centered drug * centered age, call it “centered age*drug”\nWe can’t use MEAN() to center variables in jamovi since it works across variables, one row at a time. What we want is to take the overall mean of a variable and subtract it from each measurement.\nSo, use VMEAN() to center variables in jamovi.\nCompare the new results (on the left) to the results we saw when using the interaction term we created manually (on the right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.0.2 Centered interaction in JMP\nThe “Model Fit Measures” are identical. Centering has no effect on \\(R^2\\) or any sums of squares.\nCentering also had no effect on the slope for the interaction, or on its standard error. But, look at the individual “age” and “drug” predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese slopes are different, because they are being calculated at the mean value of the other.\nCentering also reduces the standard errors of the individual slopes!\n\n\n2.8.0.3 Centered interaction in jamovi\nLook at the slope for drug when using a centered interaction: it’s the same value we calculated by plugging the mean of age into the interaction term in the non-centered model!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slope for age in the centered model is harder to interpret. It is calculated at the “average” for drug, which doesn’t make real world sense.\n\n\n2.8.0.4 Only centering one predictor in jamovi\nIt would be best if we could center “age” but not drug.\nBut we already created centered age when we created the centered interaction.\nNow we need to create the new interaction where only age is centered. Create a new column and define it as “drug * centered age”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.0.5 Only centering one predictor in JMP\nHere are the results. Compare them to the previous two versions:\nOnly age centered:\n\n\n\n\n\nAge and drug centered in the interaction:\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing centered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.0.6 Only centering one predictor in jamovi\nFirst, the slope for the interaction is the same in all three models.\nSecond, the slope for drug is the same in both centered models, but different in the non-centered model. It is the centering of age in the interaction that changed the slope for drug.\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, the slope for age is the same in both models for which drug is not centered. This allows us to interpret it as before: slope for age is 0.0125 for the NSAID and is 0.0125 − 0.2493 = −0.2368 for the DMARD\nFourth, the standard error for drug is substantially smaller when age is centered in the interaction. This is typically the case when centering a continuous variable in an interaction.\n\n\n2.8.0.7 Interpreting the intercept when centering\nFinally, the intercept is different in all three models.\nNormally we don’t care about the intercept, but centering allows the intercept to be meaningfully interpreted.\nSince \\([Center]age = age - \\overline{age}, [Center]age = 0 \\text{ when } age = \\overline{age}\\)\nRemember that the intercept is interpreted as the “predicted value of the response when the predictors equal zero”.\nSo, when centering, the intercept is the predicted value of the response when the centered predictors equal their mean.\nGoing back to our example, the predicted reduction in inflammation (before minus after) for a patient at the average age in our data set who got the NSAID is 2.665.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted reduction in inflammation for a patient at the average age who got the DMARD is 2.665 + 2.171 = 4.836"

    "text": "2.9 Standardizing predictor variables\nWe will briefly consider an extension on centering: standardizing.\nRecall from your introductory statistics course the standardization “z” formula:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}, \\text{ or in words: } z = \\frac{\\text{value - mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}}\n\\]\nTo center a variable, we subtract the mean. To standardize, we subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation.\n\n2.9.0.1 Why standardize?\nJust like with a centered variable, the mean of a standardized variable is zero. So, standardizing has all the same benefits as centering when it comes to interpretation of interactions.\nStandardizing has an additional potential benefit: the slope can be interpreted as the predicted change in \\(Y\\) for a one standard deviation increase in \\(X\\) (while holding all other predictors constant).\n\\(Z\\) values are interpreted as “number of standard deviations from the mean”. And so increasing \\(Z\\) by \\(1\\) implies increasing \\(X\\) by \\(1\\) standard deviation.\n\n\n2.9.0.2 Standardizing in jamovi\nTo standardize in jamovi we will need to create a new column defined by (age – VMEAN(age)) / VSTDEV(age).\nWe will also need to create a column for the new interaction and define it as drug*Standardized age\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the results when age is standardized:\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare to the results when age is centered:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the intercepts are the same. In both cases, the predicted reduction in inflammation for a patient at average age getting NSAID is \\(2.665\\). Likewise, in both cases this prediction is \\(4.836\\) for DMARD.\nWhat has changed is the slope for terms involving age. Now, a one unit increase in standardized age is a one standard deviation increase in age.\nSo, for NSAID, the predicted difference in inflammation reduction for two people whose ages are one standard deviation apart is \\(0.14\\). For DMARD, it is \\(0.14 – 2.79 = -2.64\\).\nHow much is a standard deviation? We can look it up…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.0.3 Interaction and centering / standardizing summary\nThis has been a long example. I encourage you to load up the data yourself and play around with it in jamovi. At the minimum, make sure you can re-create the results in these notes.\n\nThe most important take-aways:\n\nInteraction terms allow the slope of predictor to change for different values of another predictor.\nCentering helps make regression coefficients (slopes and intercepts) more interpretable. Standardizing allows you to interpret them in terms of one standard deviation changes, rather than “one unit” changes."

This will create a new column with a residual for each row.\nThe option is under the last drop-down menu, under “Save”.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a plot of the residuals, select “Q-Q plot of residuals” under “Assumption Checks” in “Linear Regression”\nThe Normal Quantile plot is also known as the QQ plot, for “quantile quantile”.\nIt is easier to assess normality with a QQ plot than with a histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Assessing normality with a QQ plot\nOn Canvas under Simulations there is a “QQ plot generator” app.\nThis app allows you to manipulate a distribution, sample from it, and then view a histogram next to a QQ plot. It is meant to give you an idea of how QQ plots work.\nBy default, it draws data from a normal distribution. But, you can add “skewedness” or “peakedness” (aka kurtosis) to make the distribution non-normal. You can also adjust sample size.\n\nA QQ plot shows you how much the distribution of your data “agree” with a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe horizonal axis gives the distribution data would follow if it were perfectly normal.\nThe vertical axis gives the distribution your data actually follows.\nThe diagonal line shows perfect agreement between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big advantage of the QQ plot vs. the histogram is that very often data that come from a normal distribution don’t look normal, especially if the sample size is small.\nIn this case, the histogram isn’t clearly normal. But, on the QQ plot the data are close to the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the data still veer from the diagonal line to some extent, even though we know for a fact they came from a normal distribution.\n\n\n3.3.3 Limitations of QQ plots\nAs you can see from the app, sometimes data that come from a normal distribution don’t sit right on the line.\nSometimes data that come from a skewed distribution look similar to data that come from a normal distribution\nIt’s easier to assess normality when sample sizes are larger.\nAs it turns out, the assumption of normality is not vital to the validity of a regression model. If the QQ plot is vague, you’re probably fine. We only worry when we see extreme non-normality.\n\n\n3.3.4 Tests for normality (not recommended)\nThere are statistical tests, such as “Shapiro-Wilks” or “Kolmgorov-Smirnov”, for which the null hypothesis is that the data come from some specified distribution, like the normal.\nRejecting this null means that the data “significantly” disagree with the assumption of normality.\nI do not recommend using this test. The problem is that, when the sample size is large enough, even small deviations from normality will be statistically significant. But small deviations from normality are OK. Only major deviations are concerning."

This is sometimes referred to as a “leave one out” method.\nCook’s Distances quantify how much the predicted values of the response variable change when an observation is removed.\nRecall that, in simple regression, the predicted values are the values on the regression line.\nIt is hard to interpret the actual values for Cook’s Distances. Values greater than 1 are often considered “influential”.\nThe formula shows that it is based on the sum of the differences in predicted values between a model with the data point included and a model with it removed:\n\\[\n\\text{Cook's Distance for data point } \"i\" = D_i = \\frac{\\sum^n_{j=1}(\\hat{y}_i - \\hat{y}_{j(i)})^2}{MSE * p}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{y}_{j(i)}\\) is the predicted value of the response variable when the model is re- fit with the \\(i^{th}\\) data point removed, and \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in\nA Cook’s Distance is calculated for every data point. The option to do this in jamovi is under “Save” in “Linear Regression”. This creates a new column with a Cook’s distance for each row.\nThe saved Cook’s Distances can then be plotted. Any possibly influential points will usually stand out clearly from the rest.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo quickly narrow in on the influential counties, we can filter out all the small Cook’s distances.\nAfter implementing the filter, we can see that all rows which do not meet the criteria of the filter are excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly rows 13 and 50 should be highlighted for Dade and Palmbeach county which have cook’s distances of 1.983 and 3.786."

Consider instances of no correlation vs. heavy correlation:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are uncorrelated, we see lots of instances of \\(x_1\\) values differing a lot when \\(x_2\\) values are equal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are highly correlated, we never see instances where \\(x_2\\) values are equal but \\(x_1\\) values are highly correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upshot is that, when \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are highly correlated, the regression procedure has a difficult time distinguishing between the “effect” of \\(x_1\\) on \\(Y\\) and the “effect” of \\(x_2\\) on \\(Y\\).\nExtreme example: if we had degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit as predictors in the same model, it would be impossible to tell their effects apart. You can’t change Celsius while holding Fahrenheit constant!\nThe practical consequence is that the standard errors for the slopes of (multi)collinear predictors are much larger than they would be if it were not for the (multi)collinearity.\nIf two or more predictors are perfectly correlated (\\(r=1\\)), then the model cannot be fit and jamovi produces an error:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \\(X1\\) and \\(X2\\) are perfectly correlated. jamovi cannot estimate a slope for \\(X2\\).\n\n\n3.6.2 Collinearity example: Florida election data\nIn the Florida election data, we used total votes for each county as our predictor variable.\nThere is another variable called “Total_Reg”. This is the total number of registered voters in each county.\nUnsurprisingly, Total_Votes and Total_Reg are highly correlated:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we run two separate simple regression models, we get very similar results:\n\\[\nBuchanin_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Total\\_Votes_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nBuchanin_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Total\\_Reg_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nBut look what happens if we use Total_Votes and Total_Reg as predictors in the same model:\n\\[\nBuchanin_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Total\\_Votes_i + \\beta_2Total\\_Reg_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo important things to note:\nP-values on slopes are much larger than for the individual models\n\\(R^2\\) is larger than on either individual model!\nLooking at the estimates and standard errors in all three models, we see that the standard errors are much larger in the multiple regression model. These estimates are “unstable” – their values will change a lot if the data change a little.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know the association between Total_Reg are Buchanan is actually positive. But with so high a standard error, the slope for Total_Reg turned out negative!\n\n\n3.6.3 Variance inflation factor (VIF)\n(Multi)collinearity can be assessed using a “Variance Inflation Factor”, or VIF. A VIF is calculated for the \\(j^{th}\\) predictor variable as:\n\\[\nVIF_j = \\frac{1}{1-R^2_j}\n\\]\nWhere \\(R^2_j\\) is the \\(R^2\\) from a regression model with predictor \\(j\\) as the response variable and all other predictors still as predictors.\nIn the Florida election example, the VIF for Total_Votes can be found using the \\(R^2\\) for the model:\n\\[\nTotal\\_Votes_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Total\\_Reg_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis \\(R^2\\) is huge! Plugging it into the formula:\n\\[\nVIF_{Total\\_Votes}=\\frac{1}{1-0.997} = 333.33\n\\]\nThankfully we don’t have to do this by hand. In jamovi, under “Linear Regression” select “Collinearity statistics”:\n\n\n\n\n\nVIF &gt; 10 typically is considered large (note that this would imply \\(R^2 = 0.9\\) between predictor variables).\nThe most obvious thing to do in the presence of (multi)collinearity is to remove one or more correlated predictor variable. From a scientific standpoint, you also may not want highly correlated predictors in the same model.\n\n\n3.6.4 When should we worry about (multi)collinearity?\n(Multi)collinearity is a potentially huge problem if the goal of the regression model is to interpret the estimated slopes.\nThis is because it increases the standard error of these slopes, making their values less reliable. Some people say it makes slopes “unstable”.\nIt may also complicate the interpretation of slopes: you are trying to statistically “hold constant” a predictor variable that doesn’t naturally stay constant when the other predictor varies. This isn’t necessarily a problem, but it is something to be aware of.\nHowever, (multi)collinearity does not negatively impact the predicted values themselves. Remember that it didn’t hurt the \\(R^2\\) value in the Florida election example. \\(R^2\\) tells you how good your predictions are.\nSo, if the model is only for predicting, you probably don’t need to worry about using correlated predictor variables. Just beware when interpreting the slopes."

    "text": "3.7 Log transformation\nRecall the regression model:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{pi} + \\epsilon_i, \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0,\\sigma)\n\\]\nSometimes we can correct violations of model assumptions by applying a mathematical transformation to the response or predictor variables.\nThe most common transformation in Statistics is the log transformation:\n\\[\nln(x) = log_e(x)\n\\]\n\\(ln(𝑥)\\) is the inverse function of \\(e^𝑥\\), where \\(𝑒 = 2.718 \\dots\\)\nIn other words, \\(ln(e^x) = x\\)\nExample: \\(𝑒^3 = 20.086; ln(20.086) = 3\\)\nSo, the natural log of \\(x\\) is the number you would have to raise \\(e\\) to so that you’d get \\(x\\).\nNote: in statistics, when we say “log”, we usually mean “natural log”. It turns out that the distinction is not very important. I’ll say “log transform”\n\n3.7.1 Why log transform?\n\nThere are two main reasons for log transforming a variable:\n\nTo correct for skew in data or residuals\nTo interpret increases in a variable as multiplicative rather than additive.\n\n\nBoth can be understood by recognizing an important property of logarithms; they “turn addition into multiplication”\n\\[\nlog(𝐴) + log(𝐵) = log(𝐴𝐵)\n\\]\nIn this sense, logarithms turn addition into multiplication.\nExample: suppose we have data for a skewed variable \\(X_1\\):\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we define \\(x_2 = ln(x_1)\\):\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a toy “data set”. I chose \\(x_1\\) so that \\(x_2 = ln(x_1)\\) would just be the integers \\(1\\) through \\(10\\).\nNote: there is no more skew.\nAlso note: increasing \\(x_2\\) by one unit results in multiplying \\(x_1\\) by \\(e\\). Addition in \\(x_2 = ln(x_1)\\) is the same thing as multiplication in \\(x_1\\).\n\n\n3.7.2 Same again, with log base 2\nEven simpler: define \\(x_2\\) as log base \\(2\\) of \\(x_1\\), i.e. \\(log_2(x_1)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow increasing \\(x_2\\) by one unit is equivalent to multiplying \\(x_1\\) by \\(2\\). Addition in \\(x_2 = log_2(x_1)\\) is the same thing as multiplication in \\(x_1\\).\n\n\n3.7.3 Log transforming right-skewed data\n\nSkewed data can be bad for regression, in that it can lead to:\n\n-   Non-linear relationship between X and Y\n\n-   Influential outliers\n\n-   Non-normal residuals\n\n-   Non-constant variance in residuals\nSo a simple log transformation can sometimes go a long way toward making the regression model fit the better!\nIt is most common to log transform a response variable, because assumptions about residuals apply to \\(Y\\), not \\(X\\).\nBut if \\(X\\) is skewed, the model can benefit from a log transformation of \\(X\\).\nBear in mind that log transformation will affect the interpretation of slope coefficients!\nIf \\(X\\) is log transformed, then a one unit increase in \\(ln(𝑋)\\) corresponds to multiplying \\(X\\) by \\(e \\approx 2.72\\). So the slope for \\(ln(𝑋)\\) tells you how much \\(Y\\) increases when \\(X\\) is multiplied by \\(2.72\\). Or, even better, use log base \\(2\\) and the slope will give how much \\(Y\\) changes when \\(X\\) is doubled.\nIf \\(Y\\) is log transformed, then the interpretations of slopes get more complicated. Here’s the math, with the error term omitted for convenience:\n\\[\nln(y_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\therefore y_i = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i}\n\\]\nIncrease \\(X\\) by \\(1 \\dots\\)\n\\[\ny_i^* = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(X_i + 1)} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i} \\cdot e^{\\beta_1}\n\\]\nSo, when \\(Y\\) is log transformed, a one unit increase in \\(X\\) multiplies predicted \\(Y\\) by \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\)\n\n\n3.7.4 Interpreting slope as a % change in outcome\nRecall the heights vs. wages data from group project 1. The paper reported this estimated model:\n\\[\nln(\\text{wage}) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + 0.002\\text{(Adult Height)} + 0.027\\text{(Youth Height)} + 0.024\\text{(Age)}\n\\]\nSo, when comparing two adults \\(1\\) inch apart in height but with the same youth height and age predicted wage is multiplied by \\(e^{0.027} = 1.027\\) for the taller adult.\nMultiplying by \\(1.027\\) can be thought of as increasing by \\(2.7\\%\\)\n\n\n3.7.5 Log transformation applied example\nHere is the percent change formula:\n\\[\n\\%\\text{ change (from A to B)} = \\frac{B-A}{A}*100\\%\n\\]\nIf B is \\(1.027*\\)A, then\n\\[\n\\%\\text{ change} = \\frac{1.027*A - A}{A}*100 = \\frac{0.027A}{A}*100 = 2.7\\%\n\\]\nSo, when comparing two adults 1 inch apart in height but with the same youth height and age, predicted wage is \\(2.7\\%\\) higher for the taller adult.\n\n\n3.7.6 Log transformation in \\(Y\\) vs. in \\(X\\)\nRemember that log transformation “turns addition into multiplication”. So, to keep track of how log transforming \\(Y\\) vs. log transforming \\(X\\) affects your model:\n\\[\n\\text{log}(Y_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{vs.}\n\\]\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{log}(X_i) + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nIf you log transform \\(Y\\) but not \\(X\\), your model estimates the multiplicative change in predicted \\(Y\\) for an additive change in \\(X\\).\nIf you log transform \\(X\\) but not \\(Y\\), your model estimates the additive change in predicted \\(Y\\) for a multiplicative change in \\(X\\)."

For one, the \\(Total\\_Votes^2\\) term is non-significant.\nBut think back to multicollinearity. Each polynomial term will be correlated with the other terms – after all, \\(Total\\_Votes\\), \\(Total\\_Votes^2\\), and \\(Total\\_Votes^3\\) must all be correlated.\nNote that jamovi will not produce VIFs in GLM. Intuitively we know these will be highly correlated with each other.\nIt turns out that centering helps in polynomial models:\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default jamovi centers polynomials which makes their standard errors smaller than if they were not centered. But, these estimates are not interpretable; you cannot hold \\(Total\\_Votes^2\\) constant while increasing \\(Total\\_Votes\\).\nIn this example, the two counties with the highest total votes are heavily pulling on the regression line."

    "text": "3.10 Back to basics: is the model sensible?\n\nBack to basics: regression models are typically used for two purposes:\n\nPredicting values of the response variable, using the predictor variables. This is done by plugging values for the predictor variables into the estimated model.\nEstimating the association between each individual predictor variable and the outcome while statistically holding other predictor variables constant. This is done by interpreted estimated slope coefficients.\n\n\n\n3.10.1 If you just want to make predictions\n\\(R^2\\) is the easiest to understand statistic for assessing how well your model makes predictions. The closer to \\(1\\), the better.\nMulticollinearity isn’t an issue. It doesn’t affect predicted values.\nBUT – beware of overfitting! The more complex your model, the more risk you take of modeling noise instead of signal.\nAlso, be aware that \\(R^2\\) can never go down when adding predictors. You can add complete nonsense predictor variables, and the worst that will happen to \\(R^2\\) is that it stays the same.\n\n\n3.10.2 If you want to interpret slopes\nAlways remember that each slope is interpreted under the assumption that all other predictor variables are being held constant, i.e. “controlled for”.\nThe more predictor variables in the model, the less sense this will make.\nExample: wage vs. height study:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn model 4, the estimated slope for youth height can be interpreted as:\n“The predicted difference in ln(wage) for two people one inch apart in youth height, but equal in adult height, whose mothers have the same # of years of schooling and are both in either skilled fields or work or not, whose fathers have the same # of years of schooling and are both in either skilled fields or work or not, and who have the same number of siblings.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe this is the best way to think about the association between youth height and wages. But it is fairly complicated.\nIf you’re going to try to make “real world” sense out of regression results, your model should be informed by theory.\nThis is necessarily subjective! You have to choose which variables you think are important. You have to think about what makes sense.\n\nThis might require:\n\nLog transforming a variable solely because you like the multiplicative interpretation better than the additive interpretation.\nKeeping a variable in a model even though it isn’t statistically significant.\nRemoving a variable you are interested in, because it doesn’t make sense to “hold it constant” when estimating slopes for other variables.\n\n\n\n\n3.10.3 Is the model missing something important?\nThere is another variable in the Florida election data set that could be worth including: “Reg_Reform”: the total number of voters registered with the Reform Party. Pat Buchanan was the Reform Party candidate. Let’s add it to the model:\n\\[\nBuchanan_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Total\\_Votes_i + \\beta_2Reg\\_Reform_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis residual plot looks great!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that the curvature in the previous residual plots went away when adding an important variable to the model. No need to mess with polynomials after all!\nAlso, the \\(R^2\\) is roughly the same as in the cubic model using only total votes as a predictor.\nSo we have roughly equal fit, without having to worry about overfitting, and without having to give up interpretability of the slopes.\nOne downside: there is some collinearity. Look at the VIFs.\n\n\n\n\n\nVIF of about \\(5\\) implies \\(\\frac{1}{1-R^2}\\approx 5\\) when using the \\(R^2\\) from:\n\\[\nTotal\\_Votes_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Reg\\_Reform_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nSo, this \\(R^2\\) is about \\(1 − \\frac{1}{5} = 0.8\\). And so \\(r = \\sqrt{0.8} =0.89\\) . These predictors are strongly correlated.\n\nNote also that total votes is not significant.\nBut: the slope for \\(Reg\\_Reform\\) has a nice interpretation:\nWhen comparing two counties with the same number of votes cast in the election, a county with an additional registered Reform Party member is estimated to have \\(2.24\\) additional votes, on average, for Pat Buchanan.\nShould total votes be taken out of the model? This is a subjective decision.\n\n\n3.10.4 What would you like to “control” for?\nIn regression analysis, we usually emphasize (correctly) that correlation does not imply causation.\nHowever, if you have knowledge or beliefs about causal direction, you should take these into account when choosing your variables!\nExample: in the rheumatoid arthritis study, we were looking at the effect of drugs on inflammation level. In particular, we were comparing how effective they were at reducing inflammation. Suppose we also asked patients to rate their mobility level (RA tends to reduce mobility).\nOur model might be:\n\\[\nDifference_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1age_i + \\beta_2drug_i + \\beta_3(age*drug)_i + \\beta_4mobility_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nNow, when interpreting the previous slopes, I am comparing average reduction in inflammation (“difference”, the response variable), between two people who have the same mobility level. But if they have the same mobility level, then they will have more similar inflammation levels than if we allowed mobility level to differ.\nIn other words, because the drug reduces inflammation and improves mobility, “controlling” for mobility will make it look like the drugs are less effective than they really are.\n\n\n3.10.5 Beware the “kitchen sink” approach\nThere’s an old saying: “taking everything but the kitchen sink”.\nIt can be tempting to toss everything but the kitchen sink into a regression model, especially when you have loads of variables that all seem like they’d be associated with the response.\nBut beware! Adding in one predictor can have a dramatic effect on the slopes of other predictors, as well as on their standard errors.\nIt really really really matters that each slope is estimated as though all other predictors are held constant. This can reveal otherwise unseen effects, but it can also obscure otherwise obvious effects or induce apparent effects that aren’t real. There is no substitute for scientific reasoning when choosing a model.\n\n\n3.10.6 The model is simpler than what’s being modeled\nLet’s take a step back and ask: why are we fitting data to models?\nWell, we are interested in the real world. And the real world in incredibly complicated. Maybe incomprehensibly complicated.\nSo, we simplify things using models. We hope that the model captures the essence of what we care about in the real world. But we know it is a simplification; perhaps an extreme simplification.\n“All models are wrong; some are useful” – George Box\nConsider how the regression model describes where data comes from:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i} + \\epsilon_i, \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0,\\sigma)\n\\]\nThis says that to get data, we pick a value for X, go to a line, then randomly draw a value from a normal distribution and add this to the value on the line. And that’s where data comes from!\nExcept, that’s not where data comes from. This is a model. It is a simplification of reality. We use these models because we think they will help us answer questions we care about (e.g. make predictions, identify associations between variables). Don’t forget that the model is not the thing itself."

That’s it.\n\n4.1.1 ANOVA is regression presented differently\nOK, there’s more to say about ANOVA than just “regression with categorical predictors.”\nANOVA is typically used to analyze data from experiments. In experiments, the categorical predictors are usually groups to which experimental units (aka subjects) are assigned. ANOVA tends to focus on comparing means of different groups to one another. Although ANOVA is “just” regression, there are conventions for reporting ANOVA results that are simpler and cleaner than what we’ve seen for regression.\n\n\n4.1.2 Indicator variables\nWe’ve seen how to incorporate a categorical predictor into a regression model when the predictor takes on two values. We create an “indicator” (aka “dummy” aka “binary”) variable that takes on the values 0 or 1. For example:\n\\[\nY_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\\[\nx_i = 1 \\text{ if \"treatment;\"} x_i = 0 \\text{ if \"control\"}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0\\) for control, and \\(\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1\\) for treatment.\nWhat if our categorical predictor takes on more than two categories?

There are “$p$” groups for predictor \\(1\\) and “$q$” groups for predictor \\(2\\).\nThe subscripts start getting messy pretty fast.\n\n4.3.1 Factorial ANOVA example\nHere’s an example of a “5x2 factorial” ANOVA, meaning that one variable has 5 groups and the other has 2.\nThe study is on memory: how many words, on average, do people recall when given certain processing tasks?\nThis example is where the graph on our Canvas home page comes from. It uses data simulated to mimic data from a 1974 Hans Eysenck study.\n\n100 subjects were split into 5 recall groups:\n\n“Counting”: subjects counted how many letters were in each presented word\n“Rhyming” subjects thought of words that rhymed with each presented word\n“Adjective”: subjects thought of an adjective that could be used to modify each presented word\n“Imagery”: subjects were told to form vivid images of each word\n“Intentional”: subjects were told to memorize the word for later recall\n\n\nCounting and rhyming are lower level processing tasks, so the hypothesis was that this group would recall fewer words than the others. Subjects were also classified as “young” or “old”.\nHere’s the ANOVA model:\n\\[\nRecall_{ijk} = \\mu + Group_j + Age_k + (Group \\cdot Age)_{jk} + \\epsilon_{ijk}, \\text{ where } \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sim Normal(0,\\sigma^2) \\\\\n\\text{ and } j = 1, \\dots ,5, k = 1, 2\n\\]\nJamovi has an “ANOVA” function and a “regression” function. We’ll use both the analyze these data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we’ll use ANOVA, using items recalled as the response (dependent) variable, and recall condition and age as factors. Note that jamovi automatically includes their interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am usually not interested in the sums of squares or mean squares in the ANOVA table, as these are not interpretable. We do have p-values for each “main effect” along with the interaction. More importantly, we have effect size statistics: eta-squared (\\(\\eta^2\\)) and partial eta-squared (\\(\\eta^2p\\))\n\n\n4.3.2 ANOVA effect sizes: \\(\\eta^2\\) and partial-\\(\\eta^2\\)\n\\(\\eta^2\\) is akin to \\(R^2\\) for one factor (main effect or interaction). It gives the proportion of variance in the response attributable to the factor in question:\n\\[\n\\eta^2 = \\frac{SS_{factor}}{SS_{total}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we see that recall condition explains the most variance by far, followed by age, followed by their interaction.\n\\(\\eta^2p\\) (partial eta-squared) is like \\(\\eta^2\\), but with the variance accounted for by the other factors removed from the denominator:\n\\[\n\\eta^2p = \\frac{SS_{factor}}{SS_{factor} + SS_{residuals}}\n\\] \nExample: for recall condition,\n\\[\n\\eta^2p = \\frac{1515}{1515 + 722} = 0.677, \\text{ and } \\eta^2 = \\frac{1515}{1515 + 240 + 190 + 722} = 0.568\n\\]\nI personally prefer \\(\\eta^2\\), as their sum cannot exceed \\(1\\). Some prefer \\(\\eta^2p\\), because it quantifies the “effect” of a factor relative to remaining unexplained variance,\n\n\n4.3.3 The means / interaction plot\nWe can make a nice plot under “estimated marginal means”:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows every combination of means across recall condition and age. It also has 95% CIs around each mean, and raw data displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is sometimes called a “means plot” or an “interaction plot”. The interaction is represented by non-parallel lines, e.g. a positive change going from “Imagery” to “Intention” for young people, but a negative change for old people.\nThe previous plot showed means for recall condition, with separate lines for age. If we flip the order of the variables, we get this:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that mean items recalled for young people is substantially higher than for old people in the last three conditions, but differs only slightly in the first two conditions.\n\n\n4.3.4 ANOVA diagnostics\nWe can also run diagnostic tests, under “Assumption checks”:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QQ plot looks pretty good.\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally do not recommend paying attention to Levene’s “homogeneity of variances” test, nor to the Shapiro-Wilk normality tests\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tests use null hypotheses of “population variance is the same in all groups”, or “the residuals were drawn from a normal distribution”. As I don’t think these model assumptions could be literally true, I am not interested in whether they can be rejected by the data.\nA “significant” violation of modeling assumptions does not imply a consequential violation. In particular, if sample size is large, trivial violations of assumption\n\n\n4.3.5 Doing all of this as regression\nThe beginning of these slides claimed that ANOVA is just regression with categorical predictors. Let’s see what our results look like if we use jamovi’s “linear regression” function rather than “ANOVA”.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predictor variables are entered as “factors” here, rather than as “covariates”, to ensure they are treated as categorical rather than as quantitative variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the interaction must be specified under “model builder”; jamovi does not create regression interactions by default.\nThere are five recall condition groups, giving four indicator variables, all compared against the baseline group “counting”, whose mean is represented by the intercept.\nThere are two “age” groups; “young” is the baseline group.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the intercept of \\(6.500\\) is the mean words recalled for a young person in the “counting” condition.\nThe first indicator under RecallCondition is “Rhyming – Counting”. Its slope of \\(1.1\\) is the difference in mean recall for these two groups, when Age = Young\nThe interaction slope for “Rhyming – Counting” is \\(-1.2\\).\nSo, for Age = Old, the difference in mean recall is \\(1.1 +(-1.2) = −0.1\\)\nThe interaction terms are all indicators, that “turn on” when Age = Old, and “turn off” when Age = Young.\nNotice that the slope for Age (“Old – Young”) is 0.5, suggesting greater recall for older participants.\nHowever, the interaction slopes are all larger negative values.\nSo, when RecallCondition = Counting, the mean items recalled for Age = Old is larger than for Age = Young. But for all other recall conditions, the interaction slopes turn this negative, and mean items recalled is larger for younger participants.\n\n4.3.5.1 Main regression results\n“Estimated Marginal Means” under regression will produce a similar plot to the one made under ANOVA, just without the connecting lines and raw data:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look carefully, you should be able to see how the regression results correspond to this plot. For instance, we see that the only condition where Old &gt; Young is Counting.\n\n\n\n4.3.5.2 Residual plot\nWe can get a plot of residuals vs. fitted values.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the residuals are all vertically stacked? This is to be expected when predictor variables are categorical.\nIn this case, there are 5x2 = 10 possible combinations of groups that participants could be assigned to. And so there are only 10 possible “fitted” (i.e. predicted) values that the model can produce."

    "text": "4.4 ANCOVA\nANCOVA (analysis of covariance) is ANOVA with an additional continuous predictor variable.\nTypically, this additional continuous predictor is not of primary interest; the primary interest is still comparing group means.\nThe continuous predictor is often thought of as a “covariate” – a variable that should be accounted for when drawing inference on the other variables.\nA common use of ANCOVA is for modeling an outcome when “baseline” or “pre-study” or “pre-test” scores are available.\nFor instance, consider testing different educational models on different sections of a class. Some get traditional lecture, some are completely “flipped”, and some are a combination of the two.\nIn this study, a preliminary quiz is given on the first day of class. Score on the preliminary quiz will be the covariate. Score on an end of semester quiz (“post”) will be the response variable.\n\\[\nPost_{ij} = \\mu + type_j + \\beta(pre_{ij} - \\overline{pre}) + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nHere, \\(j\\) goes from \\(1\\) to \\(3\\), for the three teaching types being compared.\nThe pre-test predictor is centered (note that \\(\\overline{pre}\\) is mean for pretests).\nImagine we believe that the mean differences between teaching types will be larger for students with lower pretest scores. To account for this possibility, let type and (centered) pretest interact:\n\\[\nCourse\\_avg_{ij} = \\mu + type_j + \\beta(pre_{ij} - \\bar{pre}) + \\gamma_j(type_j)(pre_j - \\overline{pre}) + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\n\n4.4.1 Looking at the data\nThe data file is called “test_pretest”. Here is the formatting:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot was made using Analyses / Exploration / Scatterplot. Density curves are there, just for fun:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three lines look pretty close to parallel, so there either isn’t an obvious interaction here, or it’s small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Analysis using ANCOVA\nNotice that the effect size for pre- score is far greater than the effect size for type, or for the interaction. This is not surprising.\n\n\n\n\n\nType is still significant; it’s \\(\\eta^2p\\) value is much larger than its \\(\\eta^2\\) value.\nCareful interpreting the “Estimated marginal means” plot – it takes into account only “post” scores!\n\n\n4.4.3 Analysis using regression w/ indicators\nFor the regression analysis, we’ll use two indicator variables. We don’t have to do it this way; if we just include “type”, jamovi will create the indicators for us, using the first class type listed in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the interaction estimates are small relative to their standard errors (thus producing large p- values).\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this regression model, there is not a “significant” interaction.\n\n\n4.4.4 Analysis using regression w/factor\nHere’s what happens if we put in “type” as a factor variable rather than making our own indicators. The results are the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QQ plot and residual plot both look great\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.5 Analyzing paired data: ANCOVA vs ANOVA\nAnother approach we could take would be to compute the differences in the two scores for each person, then do a regular ANOVA or regression analysis on those.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there are significant differences in mean test score change between teaching types ($F=8.94, p&lt;0.001$)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.6 Analyze differences, regression approach\nThis agrees with the ANOVA results from the previous slide: we have a statistically significant difference in mean test score differences (post – pre) when comparing “combo” to “flipped” or “traditional”. And \\(R^2 = \\eta^2\\)!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out here that taking the post – pre differences first and then comparing mean differences across teaching types produces similar results to predicting post-test scores using pre-test and teaching type as predictors.\nBut, these methods are not answering the exact same question. Using pre-test as a covariate, we answer the question “what difference do I expect in post-test scores when comparing two students with the same pre- test score but different teaching types”?\nWhen differencing first and then doing the analysis, we answer the question “what differences in the mean post-pre score change do I expect when comparing class types”?\nThese question sound similar, but they aren’t the same! Whether to use ANCOVA or do the differencing first is a matter of subjective judgement, and the experts don’t all agree (see “Lord’s Paradox” for more fun on this)."

    "text": "5.1 Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for proportions\nAt the beginning of the class we reviewed confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for means. These methods can also be used for proportions\nA proportion is just a special kind of mean, where the data are all ones and zeros.\nExample: 8 out of 10 people say “yes” to the question “Is politics too polarized?” Let yes = 1 and no = 0. Average is:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1 + 1+ 1 + 1+ 1+1+1+1+0+0}{10} = \\frac{8}{10} =0.8\n\\]\n\nWe make confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests for proportions using the exact same methods used for means. Only differences are:\n\nSampling distribution of proportions follow z, rather than t (the difference is usually trivial)\nWe denote the population proportion \\(\\pi\\) and the sample proportion \\(\\hat{\\pi}\\)\nStandard error of a sample proportion is \\(s_{\\hat{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}(1-\\hat{\\pi})}{\\pi}}\\)\n\n\n\n5.1.0.1 Political polling example\nHere are results from a recent political poll:\n\n\n\n\n\nSay we want to make a confidence interval for the proportion of registered voters who say that “things in the country are going in the right direction”.

(note: if you had raw data where each row was a single response, you would not use Freq)\nResults! There’s a lot in here…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit bar plot: displays each cell in the contingency table as a bar:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can easily see that the largest number of people were those who got the skin cream and whose rash got better.\nBut, we can also see that rashes got better at a higher rate for those who did not get the skin cream.\nWe’ll cover the chi-square results soon. Right now, let’s have jamovi directly compare proportions, using Frequencies / Independent Samples:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, jamovi quantifies what we saw in the split bar plot: that the proportion of those who got better without the skin cream is greater than the proportion of those who got better with the skin cream:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\text{\"Probability of Better, given Yes\" - \"Probability of Better, given No\" } =-0.0876 \\\\\nP(Better|Yes) - P(Better|No) = -0.0876\n\\]\nWe also see a 95% CI for this difference, which is fairly wide and just barely excludes zero\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we see the p-value testing against:\n\\[\nH_0:\\pi_{(Better|Yes)} - \\pi_{(Better|No)} = 0\n\\]\nThe two-sided p-value is 0.047, so this result is just barely significant.

    "section": "5.3 The chi-square test",
    "text": "5.3 The chi-square test\nThe chi-square ( \\(\\chi^2\\)) test is a popular hypothesis test for comparing observed frequencies to expected frequencies under a null hypothesis.\nThe null is typically that of “independence” between two categorical variables, meaning the probability an observation falls into a category for one variable does not depend on its category for the other variable\n(As a side note, \\(\\chi^2\\) is a distribution that is used for many purposes, including modeling distributions of variances. A statistic that is distributed chi-square is not necessarily being used in the context of the chi-square test outlined here)\nStaying with the skin cream example, here is the contingency table as jamovi initially reports it:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot being shown here. Top rows are observed frequencies, what jamovi calls “observed”.\nThe two middle rows are column % and row %.\nNotice that the column %’s sum to 100% down the columns, and the row %’s sum to 100% across the rows.\nWe can have jamovi display the components of a chi-square test.\nThe first of these are the expected counts under the null hypothesis of independence.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see how these “expected” counts would suggest independence, consider the relative risk:\n\\[\nRR = \\frac{P(Worse|No)}{P(Worse|Yes)} \\\\\n= \\frac{(\\frac{28.8451}{28.8451 + 99.1549})}{(\\frac{67.1549}{67.1549 + 230.845})} \\\\\n= \\frac{(\\frac{28.8451}{128})}{(\\frac{67.1549}{298})} \\\\\n= \\frac{0.2254}{0.2254} \\\\\n=1\n\\]\n\n5.3.0.1 Chi-square statistic\nThe chi-square statistic compares the expected frequencies under the null (which we denote E) to the observed frequencies in the data (which we denote O).\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\sum\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}\n\\]\nThis is a general formula that can be used when you have one variable, two variable, three variables, etc.\nMost popular use is for two variables, as in this skin cream example.\nJust to verify the math, here’s the chi-square calculation for the upper left cell of the table:\n\\[\n\\sum\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E} = \\frac{(107-99.2)^2}{230.8} + \\frac{(223-230.8)^2}{230.8} + \\frac{(75-67.2)^2}{67.2} + \\frac{(21-28.8)^2}{28.8} =3.94\n\\]\nAnd here is the jamovi output showing the full chi-square test:\n\n\n\n\n\n(“Pearson” chi-square is the classic chi-square test)\nVerifying that this chi-square statistic is indeed the sum of the chi-square values for each of the four cells:\n\\[\n\\sum\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E} = 0.6207 + 2.1336 + 0.2666 + 0.9165 = 3.937\n\\]\nThe p-value is found using the appropriate degrees of freedom for the chi-square distribution. We won’t cover this part.\nIn this case, we see that the chi-square test just barely meets the standard for statistical significance (\\(p = 0.0472\\)).\nThis is in line with the other methods we used to analyze these data.\nRecall that the test for a difference in proportions was barely significant, and the risk ratios were just on either side of significance, depending on whether “rash got worse” or “rash got better” was used as the outcome variable.\nThe chi-square test can be used when we have frequencies for a single variable. All we have to do is specify expected counts or probabilities.\nGoing back to the polling data, we can select Frequencies / N - Outcomes, and then make Answer “Variable” and Frequency “Counts”.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the null hypothesis is that equal numbers of voters feel the country is on the right vs. wrong track. Enter 0.5 for hypothesized probability:\nHere we get a very large chi-square statistic and a very small p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo surprise; the frequencies were very different!\nSide note: there are lots of different “chi-square tests”; this term refers to any test whose test statistic follows a chi-square distribution. So you may see “chi-square tests” that are not being used to test against a null of independence for categorical variables.\n\n\n5.3.1 Wrapping up\nMy personal view is that hypothesis testing should only be used when a null hypothesis is of direct scientific interest. In general, I’m more interested in statistics that quantify the size of an “effect” than I am in deciding whether or not to reject a null of “no effect”. So, I am not a big fan of this chi-square test. To compare rates for categorical variables, I prefer a 95% CI around either a relative risk or a difference in proportions, whichever seems more meaningful for the question at hand.\nIn the case of a political poll, I don’t believe that identical proportions of voters in the country would endorse two different statements, and so I’m not very interested testing this as a null hypothesis. I’m interested in how large a difference might be, and how much statistical uncertainty there is an estimate for that difference.\nThe methods we’ve covered in these notes are useful for analyzing fairly simple categorical data. In the next set of notes, we will look at logistic regression, which is a way to use regression modeling to predict the outcome of a categorical variable."

    "section": "6.1 Logistic regression",
    "text": "6.1 Logistic regression\nAll of the regression methods we’ve seen have involved models in which the response variable is normally distributed, given values for the predictor variables\nIn other words, the residuals have been modeled as normal.\nWhat if we have a different kind of response variable? In particular, consider a binary response variable. Maybe the outcomes are “yes” and “no”, or “success” and “failure”, or “present” and “absent”.\nLogistic regression is a type of “generalized linear model” (GLM) that works well for modeling binary outcome data.\nBefore we get into logistic regression, though, let’s see what happens if we use standard regression (sometimes called “ordinary least squares”, or OLS regression) with a binary response.\nWe’ll use simulated data corresponding to a study of sexual harassment reporting at a university. (Brooks and Perot “Reporting Sexual Harassment: Exploring a Predictive Model” (1991)).\nHere is data on whether or not sexual harassment at a university was reported, using the offensiveness of the behavior as a predictor variable:\n\n\n\n\n\nData points are “jittered” so that they don’t fall right on top of one another.\nSuppose we want to predict the value of “Report”, using “OffensBeh”.\nHere is the linear regression line. In this picture, the response variable takes on the values 0 and 1, and the data are not jittered.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted value of “Report” can be thought of as the predicted probability that Report=1 (for reported behavior)\nNote that this line can go below zero and above one. We don’t want to predict probability greater than 1! A straight line is not great here. Logistic regression is an alternative to this straight line model.\n\n6.1.1 The logistic regression model\nBy now we are well familiar with the linear regression model:\n\\[\nY_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{pi} + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(0,\\sigma^2)\n\\]\nHere is an equivalent way of writing it:\n\\[\nY_i \\sim Normal(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n\\mu_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{pi}\n\\]\nIn other words, the response variable is normally distributed with some mean \\(\\mu\\), and the value of \\(\\mu\\) is determined by the predictor (\\(x\\)) variables.\n\n\n6.1.2 Writing a logistic regression model\nWe will take this approach to writing the logistic regression model.\nWhat we want is a regression equation that looks like this:\n\\[\nY_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{pi}\n\\]\nBut that will work when \\(Y_i\\) does not follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n6.1.3 The theoretical logistic regression model\nResponse variable \\(Y\\) takes on the values 0 and 1.\nDenote the probability that \\(Y = 1\\) as \\(\\pi\\).\nThis can be written \\(Y\\sim Bernoulli (\\pi)\\)\n(The Bernoulli distribution is a distribution of 1’s and 0’s, where the probability of 1 is \\(\\pi\\) and the probability of 0 is \\(1 − \\pi\\))\nWe will use regression to model \\(\\pi\\), the probability that \\(Y = 1\\). This is often thought of as the probability of a “success”.\nIf we wanted, we could use this model:\n\\[\nY_i\\sim Bernoulli (\\pi_i)\n\\\\\n\\pi_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{pi}\n\\]\nThe standard deviation of a Bernoulli distribution is \\(\\pi(1 − \\pi )\\).

This is different from the normal distribution, which has two parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n\n6.1.4 Logit: log odds\nBut, as we saw in the opening example, a linear model for probability can have serious deficiencies.\nSo, instead of a linear model for probability \\(\\pi\\), we’ll make a linear model for a function of \\(\\pi\\), so that the variable on the left hand side of the equation is linearly related to the variable(s) on the right.\nIn logistic regression, we use the “logit” function, also known as “log odds”\n\\[\nlogit(\\pi) = ln(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}) = \\textit{\"log odds\"}\n\\]\nApplied to our sexual harassment example, we would like to predict the probability that harassing behavior is reported. This probability is denoted \\(\\pi\\)\nPlugging this into the logit formula:\n\\[\nlogit(P(reported)) = ln(\\frac{P(reported)}{1-P(reported)}) = \\textit{\"log odds\" of reporting}\n\\]\nThis will be our response variable for logistic regression.

    "text": "6.2 Odds\n\n6.2.1 Odds vs. probability\nTo understand logistic regression, you’ll need to understand odds.\nIn casual English, “odds” and “probability” are often used interchangeably.\nIn statistics, they are not the same thing. Odds tell you how likely one outcome is compared to another.\nFor instance, you might hear that a football team has been given “3 to 2” odds of winning a game. This means that their probability of winning is \\(\\frac{3}{2}= 1.5\\) times as big as their probability of losing. Or, that they’d be expected to win 3 times for every 2 times they lost.\nFormally, consider some outcome A, where the probability of A occurring is written as “\\(P(A)\\)”. In this case,\n\\[\nodds(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)} = \\frac{\\textit{probability A occurs}}{\\textit{probability A does not occur}}\n\\]\nThis is the ratio of the probability A occurs to the probability A does not occur. To convert odds into probability, we use:\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{odds(A)}{odds(A) + 1}\n\\]\nSome probabilities and their associated odds:\n\n\n\n\\(P(A)=\\)\n\\(Odds(A)=\\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}\\)\n\n\n\n\n0.001\n0.001/0.999=0.001001\n\n\n0.05\n0.05/0.95=0.0526\n\n\n0.2\n0.2/0.4=0.25\n\n\n0.5\n0.5/0.5=1\n\n\n0.8\n0.8/0.2=4\n\n\n0.95\n0.95/0.05=19\n\n\n0.999\n0.999/0.001=999\n\n\n\nThink of odds(A) as “how many times will A occur for every time A does not occur?”\nSometimes we add “to 1” to an odds statement, e.g. “odds of 4 to 1” means “this outcomes occurs 4 times for every 1 time it does not occur.”\n\n\n6.2.2 Back to the logistic regression model\nThe response variable for logistic regression, again, is:\n\\[\nlogit(\\pi) = ln(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}) = \\textit{\"log odds\"}\n\\]\nSo, the full logistic regression model is :\n\\[\nY_i\\sim Bernoulli (\\pi_i)\n\\\\\nln(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i})=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{pi}\n\\]\nWe are not actually interested in log odds; we only make this conversion for mathematical convenience. So, once we have \\(logit(\\hat{\\pi}_i)\\), we can \\(\\hat{\\pi}_i\\) back via the inverse logit function, \\(logit^{-1}(x)=\\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nlogit^{-1}(logit(\\pi)) \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{logit(\\pi)}}{1 + e^{logit(\\pi)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{odds}{1 + odds} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}}{\\frac{1-\\pi}{1 - \\pi} + \\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}}{\\frac{1}{1-\\pi}} \\\\\n&= \\pi\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn the context of the logistic regression model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\pi}_i & =logit^{-1}(logit(\\hat{\\pi_i}))\\\\\n&=\\frac{e^{logit(\\hat{\\pi_i})}}{1 + e^{logit(\\hat{\\pi_i})}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x_{1i} + \\hat{\\beta}_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta}_px_{pi}}}{1 + e^{\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x_{1i} + \\hat{\\beta}_2x_{2i} + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta}_px_{pi}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n6.2.3 jamovi example\nApplying this to the harassment data, we use Linear Models / Generalized Linear Models in jamovi and select Logistic under Categorical dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that “Target Level” defaults to zero. Changing it to 1 makes sense in this case; we want to predict 𝑃(𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑).\njamovi also produces a Loglikelihood ratio test, but we will just focus on “Parameter Estimates”:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is our estimated model:\n\\[\n\\textit{log odds (Reported)} = -1.7976 + 0.4869*OffensBeh\n\\]\nPlugging in large and small values for OffensBeh:\n\\[\n\\textit{log odds (Reported)} = -1.7976 + 0.4869*1 = -1.3107\n\\] \\[\n\\textit{log odds (Reported)} = -1.7976 + 0.4869*8 = 2.0976\n\\]\n\\[\n\\hat{\\pi}|OffensBeh = 1: \\\\ \\frac{e^{-1.3107}}{1 + e^{-1.3107}} = \\frac{0.2696}{1.2696} = 0.21\n\\] \\[\n\\hat{\\pi}|OffensBeh = 8: \\\\ \\frac{e^{-2.0976}}{1 + e^{-2.0976}} = \\frac{8.1466}{9.1466} = 0.89\n\\]"

So, we are not getting our \\(\\beta\\)’s by minimizing sums of squared residuals.\nInstead, the estimation procedure we use is called “maximum likelihood”. This method finds the values of the parameter estimates that maximize (i.e. make as large as possible for a given set of data) something called “the likelihood function”. The likelihood function takes a fixed set of data and an assumed distribution (e.g. normal), and gives the “probability of the data”, given some set of parameter values.\nSo, the coefficient estimates that we get in GLM output would make our data “more likely” than our data would be under any other set of possible estimates. They are the estimates that maximize the likelihood of our data."

    "text": "6.7 Poisson regression example\nWe’ll use some General Social Survey data for this example.\nPoisson is good for modeling count data, so we’ll use a response variable that takes the form of counts.\nFor this example, the goal will be to look at the relationship (if any) between the number of sibling a person has, and the number of children that person has.\nOur question will be: do people with more siblings tend to have more children? And if so, can we quantify the relationship?\nIt would be wise to collect data on covariates that we expect will also be related to the number of children someone has.\nAn obvious one is age. Older people will have more children than younger people.\nWe might also want to control for “culture”. If people from different cultural backgrounds tend to have more or fewer children, then this would definitely induce a relationship between # of siblings and # of children.\nThere are lots of possible ways to try account for cultural background. I’m choosing rate of attending religious services.\n\nSo, the variables will be:\n\n# of children\n# of siblings\nAge\nFrequency of attending religious services\n\n\nWe’ll just look at 2018 data. The GSS lets us choose any years we want, going back to 1972.\nThis data set is on Canvas, as GSS_Children_Siblings.jmp\n\n6.7.1 Poisson regression EDA\nFirst thing to do is plot our variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nYikes! There’s some cleaning to do. The instances of 98 siblings are not real data points.\nGSS data explorer website lets us look in detail at each variable. Here is part of the coding for “SIBS”:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the coding for the variable CHILDS.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, CHILDS = 9 is a value for missing data. These should also be excluded.\nThis should feel familiar – remember how messy the NLSY data was in the heights analysis?\nKeep in mind that data in public databases often have idiosyncrasies like this.\nHere are the row selection options that will select all rows with invalid responses.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce selected, they can be excluded.\nHere is the distribution of CHILDS.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks a lot like a Poisson distribution. Hooray!\nTo run the regression, use Linear Models / Generalized Linear Models and choose Poisson(overdispersion) for Frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nJMP will automatically choose the log link\nSelect the “Overdispersion tests and intervals” box\nHere are results for a simple model, where # of siblings is the sole predictor of # of children. We’ll just look at the parameter estimates and the overdispersion statistic:\n\n\n\n\n\nLetting \\(\\hat{\\lambda}\\) represent the predicted mean # of children, we have:\n\\[\nln(\\hat{\\lambda}) = 0.375 + 0.0631(𝑆𝐼𝐵𝑆)\n\\]\n\n\n6.7.2 Interpreting the slope\nYou might not be surprised to learn that, due to the log link, the exponentiated slope is interpreted as the multiplicative change in the estimated value of the response variable, given a one unit increase in the predictor variable: \\(e^{0.0627} = 1.065\\)\n\nSo, increasing # of siblings by one is associated with an 6.5% increase in # of children.\nWe can see that this is statistically significant, but it is also small.\nIt is also not obvious that % change is the best way to quantify this. Maybe an OLS model would have been more interpretable.\nIt might be more desirable to relate an additive change in siblings to an additive change in children.\nDownside is that # of children is not normally distributed.\nAs is often the case, we are trading some interpretability for a better fitting model.\n\n\n6.7.3 Overdispersion\nThe Poisson distribution makes a strong assumption: the mean should be equal to the variance.\nOften, we observe real data in which the variance is greater than the mean.\nThis is referred to as “overdispersion”.\nJamovi reports an overdispersion estimate:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overdispersion statistic is the ratio of the Pearson chi-square statistic to its degrees of freedom.\nIf mean = variance, this should be equal to 1. But it rarely is. If there is strong overdispersion, a negative binomial model should fit better.\n\n\n6.7.4 Fitting a larger model\nFor these data, it turns out that # of siblings, age, frequency of attending religious services, and the interactions between age and the other two variables are all statistically significant and all improve model fit. Here are the parameter estimate results for this model:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other predictor variables and the interactions can be interpreted in the usual ways.\nOne thing to notice is that the estimate for SIBS has not changed much. So, while the other covariates and interactions matter, they don’t substantially change our interpretation of the SIBS predictor."

This limits its flexibility.\nThe negative binomial distribution is similar to the Poisson distribution, but it is more flexible, and may be a better choice in the presence of overdispersion.\nThe negative binomial distribution is also a distribution for count data. It is interpreted as giving the number of “success” before a certain number of “failures” occur.\nThere are two parameters: \\(p\\), the probability of success, and \\(r\\), the number of failures at which counting stops.\nIf a variable \\(Y\\) is distributed negative binomial, we denote it:\n\\[\nY\\sim NB(r,p)\n\\]\nThe mean of the negative binomial distribution is \\(\\frac{rp}{1-p} = r*odds(success)\\)\nExample: suppose \\(p = 0.8\\) and \\(r = 2\\).

We will do a t-test to compare mean infection levels (quantified on some arbitrary scale).\nWe will also assume that the two treatments have an identical effect. Therefore the null hypothesis of no difference in means is true.\nThe file cows_ttest.jmp has some fake data, simulated as \\(y_i \\sim Normal(12,4)\\) for both groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the t-test gives no significant difference in means:\n\\[\n95\\% \\textit{ CI for } \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = (-18.00, 8.07), \\text{ p-value} = 0.321\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nNow suppose we measure infection level for each cow seven times after receiving treatment.\nThe file cows_repeated_ttest.csv contains data simulating this scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each cow, there are 7 observations.

In this case, we will again consider collecting data on infection level in cows under two treatments. This time, we’ll imagine collecting repeated observations over the course of a week.\nHere are the data in “wide form”. Treatment group B is highlighted to distinguish it from treatment group A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo things to note:\n\nThere is a lot of variability across cows.\nEvery cow’s infection rating goes down over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the data in “long form.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLong form is needed for most analyses.\nWe can use jamovi’s Rj-code editor to wide form to long form.

Note you will need to open the data in a new session of jamovi and rename the Day and Infection_level columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.1 Converting from wide to long form\nWe must now transform the Day column of the longform data. We want the variable Day to take on nominal integer values\nDouble click the Day column and in the Data menu select Transform / Using Transform / Create New Transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Plotting the data\nHere is a basic plot of infection rates across time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a small downward trend, and lots of noise in the data.\nBut we can account for this noise! It is due to different cows having different overall infection rates.\nHere is a similar plot, with the Y axis grouped by treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows a small decrease for treatment B.\nBut, we are still treating these observations as though they are independent.\nThey are not independent; they are correlated within each cow.\nHere is the same plot, but with “cow_ID” as the overlay variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach cow now gets its own line. The downward trend for B is clear.\nAlso, it is now clear that most of the variation in infection rate was due to differences between cows. Once this is accounted for, variability is low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Analyzing the data\nThese plots illustrate the idea behind accounting for repeated measures.\nIn this module, we will learn how to incorporate repeated measures in statistical models.\nFor now, let’s look at some different way of analyzing the data that we just plotted.\n\n\n7.4.4 Analyzing the data, assuming independence\nWe can run regression models where infection rate is the response variable and some combination of treatment and day are the predictors.\nWe know both variables matter, and that they interact – the “effect” of day on infection level depends on treatment, and the “effect” of treatment on infection level depends on day.\nThe next slide shows output for fitting this model:\n\\[\n\\textit{Infection level}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Treatment + \\beta_2Day + \\beta_3Treatment*Day + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\overset{iid}\\sim Normal(0, \\sigma)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(R^2\\) is small, suggesting this model does not explain much variability in infection rates.\nRemember, we know that a lot of variability is due to differences between cows. This is all getting “absorbed” by the error term.\nLarge error variance gives small \\(R^2\\) and large standard errors for slopes\n\n\n7.4.5 Analyzing the data, accounting for cows\nHere are results from analyzing these data using a mixed model. This mixed model accounts for differences between cows, and the fact that repeated measures taken on each cow are correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will cover the details of how mixed models work in the next set of notes. For now, note the much larger \\(R^2 = 0.83\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.6 Side by side comparison\nThe mixed model (on the bottom) gives smaller standard errors for Day and the interaction.\n\nNote what didn’t change: the parameter estimates!"

    "text": "7.5 Challenges and opportunities with repeated measures data\nRepeated measures data can be challenging to analyze, if the design gets complicated. We will see some study designs in which it isn’t immediately obvious how to set up an appropriate model.\nRepeated measures data can also be analyzed incorrectly (assuming independence) to artificially increase apparent sample size and get strong looking results that are not valid.\nBut repeated measures data can also be very useful! “Within subject” designs, in which subjects are measured repeatedly across time and / or conditions, can greatly enhance the precision and power of our inferences. This is because variability that would normally be accounted for by the error term can instead be attributed to overall differences between the subjects from whom repeated measurements were taken."

    "section": "7.6 Random effects",
    "text": "7.6 Random effects\nThe “mixed” in “mixed models” refers to a mix of random effects and fixed effects.\nAll of the predictor variables we’ve seen all semester have been “fixed effects”. What this means will only make sense in comparison to a new kind of predictor: a “random effect”.\nFixed effects variables are predictor variables for which we “estimate” a slope coefficient, usually denoted with a \\(\\beta\\). We calculate a value for this coefficient using our data, and then we treat this value (usually denoted as a \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)) as an estimate for some fixed but unknown population-level parameter.\nSometimes, though, we want our model to account for a variable that is important for explaining variability in the response variable, but for which we do not want to treat its coefficients as estimates of unknown parameters. For instance, in the previous “cows” examples, we’ll want to calculate the mean infection levels for each cow and take these into account. But, it probably doesn’t make sense to treat each cow’s mean as a population level parameter value of interest. After all, if we conducted the study again, we’d have new cows!\nTreating this predictor variable as a random effect (or random factor) will accomplish this. Random factors take on values that are treated as having been drawn at random from a larger population of possible values that might be different if we take a new sample. These random factors have coefficients (aka slopes) that are also treated as taking on random values.\nSo, with the “cows” examples, we imagined measuring the same cows over and over again. “Cow” should probably be treated as a random factor in these cases. The cows themselves were drawn from a larger population; we would not get the same cows again in a new study.\nAlso, we wanted to account for differences in the mean infection levels for each individual cow, so that we could estimate standard errors appropriate to our study designs. And these mean infection levels should also be treated as random, in that they came from some population of possible mean infection levels.\nSo, the cows are random, and their coefficients are random.\nThere are many interpretations of a “random effect”, and they aren’t always helpful. From a 2005 paper by Andrew Gelman:\n\nFixed effects are constant across individuals, and random effects vary.\n\n\n\nEffects are fixed if they are interesting in themselves or random if there is interest in the underlying population.\nWhen a sample exhausts the population, the corresponding variable is fixed; when the sample is a small (i.e., negligible) part of the population the corresponding variable is random”.\n“If an effect is assumed to be a realized value of a random variable, it is called a random effect.”\n\nSo, interpretations of what random vs. fixed effects “really mean” will vary.\nBut, formally, it isn’t so ambiguous. “Fixed” effects are treated as having “fixed” coefficients whose values we estimate and draw inference on (e.g. with confidence intervals and hypothesis tests).\n“Random” effects are treated as having “random” coefficients drawn from some distribution. We won’t estimate individual coefficients, but we will estimate the variance of the distribution from which they came.\n\n7.6.1 Subjects and Nesting\nOur main motivation right now is to have a method of accounting for repeated measurements on the same subjects.\nSo, in this class, we will look at mixed models for which the random effect is “subject”. In other words, we will make models that account for differences between subjects measured multiple times.\nIn a study in which subjects are assigned to groups, each subject is assigned to one group.\nFrom a modeling perspective, subject is “nested” within group. In general, one variable is nested within the other if values of the nested variable only occur in certain categories of the variable it is nested within.\nIn this case, cows are nesting within treatments because each cow is measures only in one treatment. A non-nested design would have each cow measured under each value of the other predictors. In other words, each cow would be measured under both treatment.\nAnother example: say we are doing an education research study and we randomly sample 4 districts in a state, then 3 schools in each district, then 7 classrooms in each school. In this case, classroom is nested within school, and school is nested within district. This is because each classroom exists in only one school, and each school exists in only one district.\nThe notation for “subject nested within group” is \\(subject(group)\\)"

The most important part is that “Cow” is random, while “Treatment” and “Day” are fixed.\nWe will not estimate coefficients for the different cows. This model treats each cow as having its own “random intercept”, meaning that the intercept, \\(\\beta_0\\), gets adjusted by some amount for each individual cow.\nAs we saw in the last set of notes, the purpose of this is to let the model estimate the effects of the “Treatment” and “Day” variables, while taking accounts of the fact that different cows will have different overall mean infection rates.\n\n7.7.1 The mixed effects model in jamovi\nTo fit this model in jamovi, use “Linear Models”, select “Mixed Model”, and then add the fixed predictors as factors and covariates and random predictors as cluster variables:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that Cow_ID is the random effect.

These notes cover studies 1 and 3; study 2 is reserved for a homework assignment.\n\n7.9.1 Worked example overview\nThis study was performed in France. The data are available at https://osf.io/rkj7y/ and the data file has a codebook sheet that defines the variables:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each study, 6th grade students are given a challenging reading comprehension assignment.\nPerformance on the assignment is the dependent variable.\nThe researchers investigate whether students’ performance is associated with their awareness of their classmates’ performance, and whether this association can be moderated by students’ awareness of the different levels of preparation given to different students.\n\n\n7.9.2 Paper abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.9.3 Study 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variables used in this study are:\n\nPerformance (response)\nVisibility condition (fixed effect)\nSocial class (fixed effect)\nVisibility X Social class interaction (fixed effect)\nSchool (random effect)\nClassroom, nested within School (random effect)\n\n\n\n7.9.3.1 Study 1 model\n\\[\n\\textit{PERF}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\beta_3X_1*PCS + \\alpha_{j(k)}CLASSE_{j(k)}(ETABLISSEMENT_k) + \\gamma_kETABLISSEMENT_k + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{ where } \\alpha_{j} \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma^2_\\alpha), \\\\\n\\gamma_k \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma^2_\\gamma), \\\\\n\\text{ and } \\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma^2_\\epsilon)\n\\]\nRefer to the codebook for variable definitions\nNote that in this study, subjects (students) are only measured once. The repeated measurements are on classrooms and schools.\nAlso note that PCS compares working class (PCS=1) to upper class (PCS=3.)\n\n\n7.9.3.2 Study 1 in JMP\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the response variable, PERF, is score on a reading comprehension test, on a scale of 0 to 20 points.\n\n\n7.9.3.3 Notes on Study 1 random effects output\n“The random effects covariance parameter estimates” table shows that there is much more residual (error) variance than there is variance across classrooms or across schools.\nOne very odd result: the classroom variance estimate is negative! But variances cannot be negative.\nIf we had deselected “unbounded variance estimates” under Fit Model, this would be zeroed out. It is a strange quirk of maximum likelihood variance estimation that negative estimates are possible. We can ignore this, and treat the classroom variance as just very small.\n\n\n7.9.3.4 Notes on Study 1 fixed effects output\nWe see strong “main effects” for visibility condition (X1), social class (PCS), and their interaction.\nA general principle for models with strong interactions is that our interpretation should focus on the interactions.\n\nHere, the interaction coefficient is -2.69, and the coefficient for \\(X_1\\) is 1.12.\nFor the Effect of \\(X_1\\) “-1 - 1” refers to the “differences not visible” condition, in which students do not raise their hands when they have the answer. For the Effect of PCS “3 - 1” refers to change in score for upper class students vs. working class students. So, the “effect” of visibility seems to apply to working class students but not to upper class students, since –2.69 and 1.12 nearly cancel each other out.\n\n\n7.9.3.5 Plotting the fixed effects\nHere is the plot reported in the paper, and the same plot in JMP:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice of using a bar plot to show means is common, but flawed. The bars don’t mean anything; all they do is go up to the means.\nHere is what this looks like using boxplots instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this plot shows variability in the data, where the bar plot does not.\n\n\n\n7.9.4 Study 3\nIn Study 2, social class is not used. Rather, some students are given better preparation for the reading comprehension test than others.\nSimilar results are found: those with worse preparation perform more poorly when students are told to raise their hands after determining the answer.\nIn Study 3, the authors attempt to “undo” this effect by informing the class that some students were given better preparation than others. Half the classrooms are made aware of this; the other half are not.\nThe variables in this study are almost the same as in study 1, with these changes:\n\nX1 is “context”:\n\n-1 = awareness of the disadvantage\n1 = unawareness of the disadvantage\n\nX2 is “level of familiarity” with the reading material, based on intentional preparation given by the researchers:\n\n-1 = high level\n1 = low level\n\n\n\n7.9.4.1 Study 3 model\n\\[\n\\textit{PERF}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\beta_3X_1*X_2 + \\alpha_{j}CLASSE_{j}+ \\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\text{ where } \\alpha_{j} \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma^2_\\alpha), \\\\\n\\text{ and } \\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma^2_\\epsilon)\n\\]\nIn this data set, there is no variable for “school”, only one for “classroom”. This isn’t explained in the paper.\n\n\n7.9.4.2 Study 3 in jamovi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with before, the variance across classrooms is very small relative to the error variance.\nThe largest overall effect is \\(X_2\\): level of familiarity with the material. Students who are better prepared score higher.\nThe negative interaction shows that the difference in performance between those with higher vs. low familiarity is lower when students are aware of the difference in familiarity.\nThe interaction of -5.81 just about cancels out the estimated slope for \\(X_1\\)[-1] of 4.24.\nThis shows that there is very little difference in scores between students with high preparation who are and are not aware of the advantage.\nIt helps to look at the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe generic “\\(X_1\\)” and “\\(X_2\\)” have been replaced with more meaningful titles.\nAnd here are the bar plots shows in the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the boxplots show more information.\nIn this case, the boxplots reveal a potentially concerned “ceiling effect”: many students earned the maximum possible score. This can’t be seen from the bar plot."

    "text": "8.2 Power\nMany of the statistical issues surrounding the replication crisis concern “power”.\nStatistical power is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), in the case that \\(H_0\\) is false.\nIn terms of real-world effects, if power is high, then there is a good chance of “detecting” an effect – i.e. of declaring statistical significance.\nIf power is low, then even if a real-world effect exists, the result of a hypothesis test will likely be “fail to reject” \\(H_0\\); i.e. non-significance.\n\n8.2.1 Type I and Type II errors\nA “Type I” error occurs when a true \\(H_0\\) is rejected. In other words, if we declare a result “statistically significant” even though no real-world effect exists, we are committing a Type I error. This is sometimes called a “false positive” outcome.\nA “Type II” error occurs when a false \\(H_0\\) is not rejected. In other words, if we declare a result “not significant” even though a real-world effect does exist, we are committing a Type II error. This is sometimes called a “false negative” outcome.\nLow statistical power implies a high chance of a false negative.\n\n\n8.2.2 Problem: power is unknown!\nThe “true” power of a statistical test is almost never known. To calculate power, one must assume the “true” size of the effect being studied.\nFor instance, power to reject the null hypothesis that a new drug is equally effective as a previous drug depends in part upon how different the two drugs are in effectiveness. But if we knew that, we wouldn’t need to conduct a study!\nThere has been research estimating average statistical power in various research fields, and reason to believe that low power studies are not uncommon. Which means that a lot of these replication failures might be “false negatives”, rather than the original studies being “false positives”."

Flexibility renders the classical p-value interpretation invalid.\nAnother way of putting it: if you report a p-value as “the probability of obtaining results this extreme, assuming the null is true”, you are implicitly claiming you would have conducted the identical analysis, even if the data had been different in any way.\n\n\n8.4.2 The null could be false due to something you haven’t thought of\nPerhaps “\\(H_0\\) is false” does not imply that the version of “not \\(H_0\\)” you have in mind is true.\nIn observational studies, we must always think about possible confounders. Maybe there is a “significant association” between variables for some reason that isn’t being considered.\nIn experimental studies, we must consider all the possible effects of our interventions. Did the experiment produce “significant” results for a reason we didn’t consider, e.g. poor control, biased question wording?\nExample: CSU has found that students who complete their Math and Composition AUCC requirements during their first year earn higher grades and have higher graduation rates than those who do not.\nDoes this suggest that completing these requirements in the first year results in higher grades and a higher chance of graduation?\nCould this “statistically significant” effect be due to confounding factors? Is it even reasonable to suspect that students who complete these classes during their first year should have identical grades and graduation rates as those who don’t? This is what the rejected \\(H_0\\) states. Are we impressed that it is rejected?\n\n\n8.4.3 Do we even think the null could be true?\n“All we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and B are always different – in some decimal place – for any A and B. Thus asking ‘Are the effects different?’ is foolish” - John Tukey\nThe null can be used as a “Straw Man” that no one really believes. Overturning a straw man null may not be that impressive.\nA good question to ask: “would we expect this null to be true?”\nIf we are performing an experiment, the null is that the treatment does literally nothing. Is this common?\nIf we are analyzing observational data and testing for “significant correlation”, the null is that there is precisely zero correlation at the population level. Do we think this is possible?\nPsychology/Philosopher/Statistician Paul Meehl called this the “crud factor”: the extent to which everything is correlated with everything, at least at some small level.\nBut, there are times when the null is plausible.\nIn manufacturing quality control analysis, the null is that “everything is being produced the normal way”. Defects show up as large deviations from this observed null distribution.\nIn Ronald Fisher’s “The Lady Tasting Tea”, the subject of the story claimed she could tell whether milk or tea had been poured into a cup first, simply by tasting the result. The null is that she couldn’t tell. Seems plausible.\nMy personal rule is that I am only interested in p-values when I think the null is plausible.\n\n\n8.4.4 Is there a decision to be made?\nA significance test returns a binary outcome: the results are significant, or they are non-significant.\nBinary outcomes can produce binary thinking: the temptation to think “significant” means “real” and “non-significant” means “due to chance”.\nIs coming to a binary choice even necessary? Why not just report a point estimate and standard error or 95% CI?\nIf there is an actionable outcome, a binary choice might be necessary.\nExample: deciding whether to continue investing money into a research program.\nIf the analysis is being done for the purpose of decision making, then a decision rule must be established, and “significance” can be such a rule. If the analysis is being done for the purpose of conveying information in data, I personally see no reason to add in a declaration of “significant” or “not significant”.\n\n\n8.4.5 Big sample sizes give small p-values\nConsider the t-test statistic:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{\\textit{std. error of }\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}\n\\]\nAs sample size increases, standard error decreases, the t-test statistic increases, and the p-value decreases.\nSo, the bigger the sample size, the smaller the value of \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\) that is needed to achieve statistical significance.\nUpshot: if \\(n\\) is larger, very small effects will be “significant”.\n\n\n8.4.6 eBay study example\n\n\n\n\n\n“Women had a slightly higher percentage of transactions for which positive feedback had been given in the year preceding the current transaction (99.60% for women and 99.58% for men, P &lt; 0.05)”\n(http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500599.full)"

What we want to know is “Given these data, what is the probability that \\(H_0\\) is true?” But as most of us know, what it tells us is “Given that \\(H_0\\) is true, what is the probability of these (or more extreme) data?“ - The Earth is Round (p&lt;0.05) (1994)\n“Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations” (2016) lists a large number of popular misinterpretations. Some highlights…\n“The p-value is the probability that the test hypothesis is true; for example, if a test of the null hypothesis gave P = 0.01, the null hypothesis has only a 1 % chance of being true; if instead it gave P = 0.40, the null hypothesis has a 40 % chance of being true.”\n“The p-value for the null hypothesis is the probability that chance alone produced the observed association”\n“A null-hypothesis p-value greater than 0.05 means that no effect was observed, or that absence of an effect was shown or demonstrated.”\n“Statistical significance is a property of the phenomenon being studied, and thus statistical tests detect significance.”\n“When the same hypothesis is tested in two different populations and the resulting p-values are on opposite sides of 0.05, the results are conflicting.”\n(note: all of these are wrong)"

    "text": "8.7 Assessing bias using meta-analysis\n\n8.7.1 The sampling distribution of the p-value\nIt is intuitive to think that larger p-values are more likely to occur than smaller p-values when the null is true.\nThis is intuitive, but it is false. In most testing scenarios, all p-values are equally likely when the null is true. The distribution of p under \\(H_0\\) is uniform:\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation: https://csu-statistics.shinyapps.io/visualize_power/\nWhen the null is false, the distribution of p is right skewed. The greater the statistical power, the greater the skew.\nHere is the distribution of p for Cohen’s d = 0.5 and n = 30, implying power \\(\\approx\\) 75%\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen null is false, smaller p-values are more likely than larger ones.\nSome people have the intuition that for weaker effects or lower power, significant p-values should be close to 0.05.\nThis is false; even for low power, very small p-values are more likely than “marginally significant” p-values. Here is the distribution of p for Cohen’s d = 0.2 and n = 30, impying power \\(\\approx\\) 19%\n\n\n\n\n\nUpshot: we should never see lots of p-values just below 0.05, even under low power.\nBut – there are papers in which many studies are performed, all of which produce p-values just below 0.05. There are bodies of published research in which p- values just below 0.05 occur too frequently.\nThis suggests some combination of “publication bias” and “p-hacking”\nFormal test: “P-curve” (www.p-curve.com)\n“P-curve” takes a collection of p-values less than 0.05 and compares them to the uniform distribution expected under \\(H_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf p-values close to 0.05 occur too frequently, the p-curve is consistent with a true \\(H_0\\), despite all p-values being less than 0.05.\n\n\n8.7.2 What N is required for sufficient power to detect obvious effects?\n\nSimmons, Simonsohn, and Leif conducted an Amazon M-Turk study (n = 697) to estimate required sample size to detect a variety of “effects” at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Examples:\n\nMen are taller than women (n = 12; i.e. n = 6 per group) People who like spicy food eat more Indian food than people who don’t like spicy food (n = 52)\nPeople who like eggs eat more egg salad than people who don’t like eggs (n = 96)\nSmokers think smoking is less likely to kill someone than do non-smokers (n = 288)\nMen weigh more than women (n = 92) (!!!!!!!!!!!)\n\n\n\n\n8.7.3 More on publication bias\n“Publication bias” is the phenomenon by which statistically significant results are more likely to be published in a journal than results that are not statistically significant.\nThere are many tools for trying to diagnose this (including P-curve)\nTest of Insufficient Variance: convert p-values to z-statistics. Expected variance of z-statistics is 1. Variance less than 1 could suggest “missing” studies.\n\n\n8.7.4 Funnel plot\nPlot effect size vs. standard error. Variance in effect sizes should decrease as standard error decreases, but effect size and standard error should not be correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation could suggest “missing” studies.\n\n\n8.7.5 Inter-ocular trauma test\n“Do the results hit you between the eyes?”\n\n\n\n\n\n(z = 1.96 is the threshold for statistical significance)"

So, they do a power analysis using the effect size and standard error from the data, and find low power.\nTHIS IS INVALID! If p &gt; 0.05, then post-hoc power must be lower than 50%.\nSo, “non-significant” results will always be identified as “low power”, post-hoc.\n\n\n8.8.5 Estimating power meta-analytically: R-Index\nR-Index: calculate observed power for each study. Compare average power to proportion of studies showing significance. Lower observed power could suggest missing studies.\ne.g. observed power = 0.6, 10 / 10 results significant; 6 / 10 expected if power = 0.6.\nIf a collection of studies all show significant results, then average observed power must be greater than 50%. But, it might not be much greater."

    "text": "8.9 Should we throw away non-significant results?\nThere are statistical problems that arise when only reporting significant results.\nThere is also a scientific problem: are non-significant results really uninteresting?\nIf the question is worth asking (“do I have evidence for this substantive hypothesis?”), isn’t the answer worth knowing?\nThe practice of throwing away non-significant results goes hand in hand with a false interpretation of NHST results: that non-significance implies “no effect”.\np-value &lt; 0.05 is commonly interpreted as evidence for an effect.\nBut, p-value &gt; 0.05 should not necessarily be interpreted as evidence for no effect.\n\n8.9.1 “There was no effect (p&gt;0.05)”\nExample: suppose three studies (A, B, and C) all aimed to estimate a standardized difference in means in terms of Cohen’s d:\n\\[\nd= \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{s_p}\n\\]\nSuppose that for each study, a p-value is also computed, testing against the null of \\(H_0: \\mu_1-\\mu_2 = 0\\)\nA 95% CI for d is also constructed.\nIn this example, all CIs contain zero, so all p-values exceed 0.05. All three tests are consistent with “no effect”.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the first CI is also consistent with a very large effect, which could be positive or negative. The third CI is consistent with no effect or a very small effect .\nBut - the p-values are the same! In all three cases, p = 0.51.\n\n\n8.9.2 Published example: knee surgery study\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article “Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus placebo surgery for a degenerative meniscus tear: a 2-year follow-up of the randomized controlled trial” assesses the effectiveness of a surgical procedure for treating a degenerative knee tear relative to a sham “placebo” surgery (!!!). https://ard.bmj.com/content/77/2/188\nThe article finds a non-significant difference between treatment and placebo, and interprets this as the treatment being “no better” than placebo. Author conclude there is “no evidence” in favor of the treatment.\nHowever, later in the paper the authors make a much stronger argument: that the 95% CI for the difference in means is fully below the minimum clinically meaningful difference, which they established a priori:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the sharp difference between these arguments:\n\n“Surgery was not effective because the difference between surgery and placebo was not statistically significant.”\n“Surgery was not effective because the 95% CI for the difference between surgery and placebo fell entirely below the minimum clinically significant difference.\n\n\nThe first argument says “the estimated difference is no bigger than what would be expected by chance.” The second says “the largest plausible value for the difference is still too small to be interesting.”"

So a distinction is drawn between exploratory and confirmatory data analyses.\n\n\n8.10.2 “Justify your alpha”\n“Justify Your Alpha” (2017), written in response, calls for allowing flexibility in alpha levels rather than defaulting to p &lt; 0.05.\nThe argument: alpha (a.k.a. the significance level) sets a trade-off between Type I errors and Type II errors.\nSmaller values of alpha lower Type I error rates but increase Type II error rates, and vice versa.\nThe optimal trade-off will be different for different research fields. FDA drug trials should not use the same trade-off as exploratory research in brand new research fields.\n\n\n8.10.3 “Abandon statistical significance”\n“Abandon Statistical Significance” (2017) calls for the elimination of thresholds entirely.\nThe argument: “significance” is just a way of taking continuous phenomena (e.g. differences in means, probabilities, correlations) and forcing them into one of two categories.\nInstead, why not report the evidence on its own terms?
